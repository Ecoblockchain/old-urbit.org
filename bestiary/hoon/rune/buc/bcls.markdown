`$+`, `buclus`, a tile for a gate which accepts `p` and produces `q`. The spectre of function signatures once again rears its ugly head - but `$+(p q)` is no different from `$_(|+(p _q))`.

###Definition###

     ++  noil
      |=  tol=?
      =<  ;~  pfix  buc
            %-  stew  
            ^.  stet  ^.  limo
              :-  '+'
                %+  cook
                  |=([a=tile b=tile] [%weed [%brls a [%bccb b]]])
                ;~(pfix lus (toad exqb))
                ==
            ==
          ==
