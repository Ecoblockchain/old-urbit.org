Urbit, `~2014.1.13`:

    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" is bemused by the @p and @da having text-span versions.
    Almost like you did that to break the runes someone came up with, and force
    them to use names. :)
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the reason to have them directly in the subject
    is that you often want to use them in path
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: s
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": sure
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so ->- and ->+, instead of just ->
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: one more character, you get two versions
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" nods.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and paths really do have to be text.  because,
    you know, text
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": that -+<> is so great, it imitates the way my poor brain
    would walk down the tree doubling and incrementing, only effortlessly
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" really likes this model of computation on a single
    subject.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes, life is much better without the silly
    "environment"
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] can't wait to see what happens when programmers
    who grew up in hoon are introduced to 20th-century languages
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": "don't let perl's elegant syntax lead you astray: it's
    not as easy as it looks!"
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" grew up speaking Perl.
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm" too.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": Hoon's syntax is crystal-clear to me!
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" 's physical manifestation appears to have communication
    problems, though.
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": try drawing a cartoon
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": I ask a coworker to test something before giving it to
    the customer, and he does the opposite.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" wonders in what universe "Do not give this to the
    customer" translates into "hand straight to the customer".
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": draw a cartoon where he gives it to the customer, then a
    princess appears and explodes him ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] is
    in the building
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": Next time I'm in Japan, I'll just give him a real-life
    reenactment of some Unicode Emoji on his desk.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] resists the temptation to use unicode emoji as
    hoons
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] but still wants to use them as output-only
    markers
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: eg, pile of poo for your stack traces...
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": ew
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": what about CAT FACE WITH WRY SMILE
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": that would be better
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] thinks pile of poo is too new to be reliable
    anyway
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" just found some buried treasure in this codebase!
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": We truncate some 64-bit values to 32-bits, and have
    done so for nearly the entire lifetime of the product
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it's okay if there are less than 4 billion
    sered
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: served
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] always wonders whether or not to check for
    32-bit reference count overflow
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": rev45000-ish has the lines introducing this issue. The
    most recent rev is 1127622.  ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] has
    left the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] doesn't know what the software is but that
    sounds like a lot of revisions
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": it would be fewer revisions if anyone besides me
    wanted to learn the version control software.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] imagines a future where every keystroke gets its
    own change number
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" imagines a past where this software worked properly.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": "this" being my reality, not Urbit. Urbit always works
    properly, in  both the past and the future.  | ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]
    imagines a past where lots of things worked properly, Detroit existed and the
    army could win a war
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Urbit has always existed, I got the code in a
    time machine
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": I got the code on a USB stick at DEFCON.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": Which is canceled this year, by the way.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: really?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: why?
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": Defcon is cancelled?
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": The Dark Tangent retired last year. Plus, I heard they
    sold out of tickets already.  ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" has left the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] can't find this on his googles, perhaps he lives
    in an alternate 2014
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": they must not have updated the website!
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is actually pretty confident that Urbit has made
    contact with one of the other 2014s
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: either that or he's being trolled...
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] sighs.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is just not cool.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": sometimes, one should not trust content from
    hiddem-lomder.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: or hatteb-mitlyd...
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": or rigryx-sovrus. let's just get all my ships out
    there.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has been too generous, frankly
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" was surprised to get 4, honestly.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has billions.  or did before he started giving
    them away.  ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" is in the building
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" is ready to surrender all but one as penance for its
    acts of trolling.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] just offered four carriers to probably our last
    angel/seed investor, if he comes through
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: obviously the same deal is available to anyone
    here if he/she has 250K under the couch
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: also ~nyt is currently going, going... at 11.7
    bitcoins
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which makes your destroyers worth...
    approximately... 0.001 cents each
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: of course they have much greater sentimental
    value!
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has almost 1/3 the market cap of Dogecoin.~satnum-maptux "yebyen" has left the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] still wonders what the hizzy is ~balweb-sarlyt
    [Mark Zavislak] has left the building ~racbes-solmun "kpm" has left the
    building
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": http://tweetnacl.cr.yp.to/software.html - curve25519
    and related functions in convenient twitterable form.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that is so djb.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] imagines a world where djb is a billionaire and
    Zuckerberg asks if you want fries with that.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" wants to live in that world. Maybe it can have a BeOS
    phone, too.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] used to work for the guy who wrote the BeOS
    filesystem.  or one of them.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": Giampolo?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Schillings.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: maybe he was the second guy on it or something.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] thinks he's at Yahoo now or something.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: he was my boss at Openwave after Bruce Schwartz
    left the building.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but Be was one of the last great system
    software companies.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": Giampaolo wrote the BeFS that replaced OFS,
    apparently. I never used OFS, I think that was in the pre-R3 Be...
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yeah maybe Schillings was OFS.  I don't know.
    I never used a Be myself... but it was cool.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" only used the x86 port.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: all that is solid melts into air.  except for
    Urbit of course.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] wishes FirefoxOS wasn't so lame.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" wishes the web weren't so lame, and has words to say
    about people's lack of attention span.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] sees lame all around him, and not just on his
    computer.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" believes twitter and facebook and youtube to have
    reduced people's attention spans to less than 5 minutes.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] doesn't use either twitter or facebook, for
    precisely that reason
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] shows his kids youtube sometimes and feels
    guilty about it, also for that reason ~racbes-solmun "kpm" is in the building
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" uses twitter, but posts to it from IRC. Occasionally
    has issues because even IRC's buffer is larger than twitter's.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] can't believe there is an entire
    multimillion-dollar company whose raison d'etre is posting to twitter as a cron
    job.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: speaking of buffers...
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": and speaking of curves:
    https://www.imperialviolet.org/2013/12/25/elligator.html
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": elligator, for those unfamiliar, is a scheme to ensure
    that an elliptic-curve point is indistinguishable from a random string.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": this is a desirable property.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hm, that looks kind of interesting
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: burnham is more the math expert on this one...
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" is an armchair mathematician. Actually, an armchair
    everything.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": Years of fell and fugitive life has atrophied the
    human element in me...  ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] is in the
    building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] had a human element but it burned out~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] has left the building ~racbes-solmun
    "kpm" has left the building ~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc] has left the
    building
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" pictures tasfyn as a hoon-emitting robot ~novrud-hanweb
    "yebyen" is in the building ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen" has left the building~satnum-maptux "yebyen" is in the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: do not use teh ^W, not when you have
    applications running
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": Sorry guys, nandchat is gone
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the event routing, she is not working so good
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: gone?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: dead, kaput, pushing up teh daisies?
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": I managed to quit all of my apps now I get %time-lost
    p=51 q=0 r=/wa
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": and %flub {}
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": can I recover from this by replaying ?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] thinks not.  ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen" is in the
    building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: on the other hand, you seem to be okay, so...
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": it kind of looks like the trick to get it back was to
    press ^W again
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is not responsible for the outcome of any such
    tricks.
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": maybe it's just the submarine that's hosed
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the n-word chat does appear to be working
    nromally ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham] has left the building ~midlys-rocpet
    [John Burnham] has left the building ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] has left the
    building ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen" has left the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] gathered that.  ~satnum-maptux "yebyen" has left
    the building
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: guys the color of the stuff coming out of
    my nose is starting to get close to the color of my (green) handkerchief
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: just fyi
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] caught con flu at 30c3 it seems
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] doesn't know what it looks like but he knows
    what it sounds like ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne] is in the
    building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] hears labfes-larzod will be out in SF pretty
    soon ~rovrel-bicmyl is in the building
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: yes
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] welcomes rovrel-bicmyl
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: last week of february
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: well, that's soon enough I guess..
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: at the rate i expect work and
    such to cause the weeks to fly by
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: god help us if we don't actually have some hoon
    doc by then
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ha ha, actually I'm just finishing up chapter 7
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: cool
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: with any luck i might
    understand some hoon by then
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: by february even little girls will know hoon
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: yeah but little girls
    probably don't get home from work and open up beers
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] plans to teach his daughter at least one hoon
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: depends on your little girl I guess
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: mine gets home from school and opens up
    pbskids.org
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I assume that because it's PBS it can't be
    rotting her brain
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: hahaha
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i wouldn't make that
    assumption
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it's PBS!  it's educational!  haha.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: maybe not but it tranquilizes her and gets her
    off my hands.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is not necessarily always the parent he ought to
    be.
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: it's interactive, at least, i
    suppose
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: indeed.  and even somewhat literate.
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: make sure you have an
    adblocker installed
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] 's daughter probably wouldn't go for a
    first-person shooter anyway, she's pretty girly
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i'm pretty sure the worst
    thing about watching tv was the ads
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: PBS doesn't have ads, it has public service
    announcements
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] isn't sure there's any such thing as a
    public-service announcement blocker
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: or a words-from-our-sponsor blocker
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: PBS is for the chic, it even has chic ads
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: because i was a college
    student and was living in a small apartment
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i never bothered to get a TV
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] takes another pull on the meth pipe and reaches
    for some Cheetos
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: so every time i see ads on TV
    now, i get really weirded out by them
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] grew up without a TV, he is from a chic family
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i watched plenty of tv as a
    kid
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: not wealthy, but quite communist nonetheless~balweb-sarlyt [Mark Zavislak] is in the building
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" gets more information out of TV when the sound is off.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: communists don't believe in TV, it is one of
    their many cultural superiorities
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] welcomes balweb-sarlyt.
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: anyway it's not just TV that
    is the problem
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: it's the advertising
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: because ads are actually
    incomprehensible mishmashes
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it's not the TV or the advertising
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it's the audience...
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: well there's that too
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the lesson of PBS is that advertising for chic
    people can be and is chic
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: an audience that can extract
    anything from those ads, an audience that is meaningfully targetted by those
    ads, is in trouble
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] doesn't need to see that to know that his
    country is in trouble
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: he works at 10th and Mission, after all~balweb-sarlyt [Mark Zavislak] has left the building
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i guess i will see 10th and
    mission soon enough
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: he could throw a stone and hit the Twitter
    headquarters.  also, three pot stores.
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: really
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" offended Twitter security by not having his license
    name match the logbook.  \/ ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes.  there's the
    upscale pot store, the middle-scale pot store, and the hilariously downscale
    pot store that can't even get it together to hav\/ e a proper sign.  \/
    \/
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: well i might have to try that
    (the stone throwing part (jk))
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] suggests that he should have chilled out by
    going around the corner to "Re-Leaf."
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: don't throw stones at Twitter, I think their
    security is pretty good...
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": Turns out, identifying as Eugene Belford and then not
    presenting an ID with that name on it, bothers some people.
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i never got around to doing
    that to the tumblr hq in NYC!!!
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yeah it might!
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] likes to sign in as Robert E. Lee.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: who's a dead ringer for Ben Bernanke, by the
    way.
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i wonder how far the BV sf
    outpost is from twitter hq
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": From PR Gnus in Washington,
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: BV?
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: bazaarvoice
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ah right that's where you work
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: one wonders how many people think:
    "BizarreVoice"... a very different kind of startup...
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: yep
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: every time
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: every single time
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] practices his bizarre voice.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that's okay, I'm a tone-deaf founder myself
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: "Tlon" sounds like a Bond villain company name.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it's even worse on our legal docs, which all
    say "Tlon Corporation."
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: how do you even pronounce it
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: T'lon.
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: oh
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Tuh-lon.
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: ohh
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i was thinking tee-lon
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: "Our reporters have learned that Tlon
    Corporation has been secretly introducing LSD into your water supply..."
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: actually we need to become a megacorporation so
    we can have a security arm - Tlon Global Security.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] always trusts content from Tlon Corporation.
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: heh
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: hahahha
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": Tlon Heavy Industries
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Tlon Propulsion Systems
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: the always trust content
    thing tho will be more literally true of BV
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" snickers.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: how so?
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": We've all seen Videodrome, yes?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is actually sadly limited in this category
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but he was thinking about always trusting
    content...
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: give me a sec let me see if
    there is a link
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" was going in the direction of malish company names.
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]:
    http://www.bazaarvoice.com/authenticity/ of course there is a link
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] used to know a tiny multimedia company called
    "Colossal Pictures."
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: hahhha
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: ... i just noticed that when
    i think of the word colossal the first thing i think is "hard to lift"
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] was actually thinking of
    http://www.bazaarvoice.com/bestiality/.
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: HAHAHAH
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": The head of Spectacular Optical says something like...
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but #EndFakeReviews sounds a little like
    #EndPoverty
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": We make inexpensive glasses for the Third World and
    missile guidance systems for NATO. We also make Videodrome, Max.
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: hashtags are a key component
    of modern marketing campaigns
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: not because anyone actually
    uses them
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: but because they suggest
    hipness etc
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes.  but eventually this becomes ridiculous
    and then played-out.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: anyway, everyone wants to end poverty, but it's
    not clear how to do it
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: true | ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis
    Yarvin]: actually I have a plan but it's not really a politically correct one
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and the same is true of fake reviews...  |~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": Is it a modest proposal?  | ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis
    Yarvin]: it's a rather immodest proposal.  | ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]:
    really San Francisco specific.  | ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it involves
    the Farallons...  | ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": Reduce the Bay Area to glass?
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: well the engineers on the
    teams in question say they've got an idea | ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth
    (raptros) coyne]: 
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: fake reviews are spam, so if you can end
    spam...
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: 
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": I had to deal with an oldweb way of handling spam
    recently.
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: well there's a way to end
    spam if you're in-control enough
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has to wash his hands every time he handles spam
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": It was unpleasant and I don't think it adds any
    security, just makes it harder to send email.
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: but uh given the events of
    today, i probably shouldn't get into it too much
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: cuil theory?  Wasn't that a failed startup,
    Cuil?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: heh the Judge is not amused.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": cuil was hilarious. the cpedia gave me so much
    amusement in those boring moments during school.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": "I know! Let's markov-chain a search engine AND
    wikipedia!"
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: what was cpedia
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": basically what i just typed.
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: oh
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: oh no
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": You would search for something, and get a mishmash of
    Wikipedia and web content.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": Not &ing kitting.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": kidding, either.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: dude that's hilarious, I totally missed it
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this is why Urbit does not go out seeking teh
    press
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: the press is a monster

    ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm": where "now" means "as of just having read chapter VII"
    and "art" means, uh, not sure what
    ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm": but I'm not complaining, as I definitely enjoyed the

    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": in the very small example, what is the & doing?
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": this one: ?:  & 47 52
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]:  is yes (true)
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so, the result is 47
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": oh okay!
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": what's no?  !?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: no is |
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": yes & 0
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": no | 1
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: believe this is actually mentioned in a
    previous chapter
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that's correct
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but there is a lot of very confusing material
    coming quite quickly...
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": there was a promise early on that the reader is not too
    stupid to learn Hoon
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": :S
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": the reader should probably start from the beginning of
    the hoon part again...
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the writer may be too stupid to teach it
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": thank you for the nice doc though!  once it's metabolized
    it'll probably have been great!
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it's actually a lot harder than I thought, but
    yes, in the structure I wound up with
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you probably want to go through it twice
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": did 7 come out last night/this morning?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: last night eh
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but I forgot to send an email
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a 3-year-old was jumping on my head
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I'll do that now...
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": reat!
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: also I'm going to give the chapters actual
    titles, the jokey ones are becoming lame
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": *g
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: fine line between lame and jokey eh
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": hoon bites back!
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": hoon goes to the pound
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": hoon is adopted by a nice family
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": hoon eats their baby
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": hoon gets rabies?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: rumors that hoon has rabies are entirely false
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it may have leprosy... or elephantiasis... but
    not rabies!
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": rather, rabies has hoon ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" is in the

    7
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the -- is not rendering properly
    ~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: bummer -- I still have to finish chapter 4
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is reluctant to send out links which don't
    render right
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that's not a bummer at all, it should drive you

    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: :-)
    ~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: I don't know about cores, but I was really
    glad to understand what nock 8 is for!
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it should all start to seem rather banal at a
    certain point ~rovrel-bicmyl has left the building ~rovrel-bicmyl is in the

    ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm": yeah, after you implement your own nock evaluator of any
    variety
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hoon just doesn't add that much over nock
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: except that you can actually program in it...
    ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm": at present, *you* can actually program in it...
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes.  also a couple of other people
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but we'll get there... really... we will
    ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm": I'm still seeing ascii soup, but I hope it'll pass
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it will pass once you start using it
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a good test is how easy it is to see syntax
    errors
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: syntax errors feel physically painful and I see
    them instantly
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: like a missing brace in C
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but at this point... ascii soup
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we need lots of cool fun exercises, preferably
    that serve webpages
    ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm": yup
    ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm": btw is the http server an arvo-level thing or a
    vere-level thing?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is arvo avec le collaboration of vere
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that is, vere is doing events at the http level
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: not at the tcp level, we don't have a tcp level
    event system yet
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] feels less uncomfortable about gating vere
    directly to tcp than he used to
    ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm": I'd really love to see an exposition of the vere/arvo
    interface.  i.e. what's the protocol for calling the operating function
    (operating core?) etc
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the closest thing is ++card in zuse.hoon
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but it is poorly organized and contains both
    input events and output actiojns
    ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm": but I'm probably just damaged in being so interested in
    that ~lapled-rammyn [Jordan Lewis] has left the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: also if you look at the Postface in hoon.hoon,
    this is the interface of the outermost core
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: about 8 arms
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the main one is ++poke, ie, send an event and
    convert it into a new state and a list of actins
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: actions, actins are proteins
    ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm": now that's some hoon-learning motivation right there
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] likes that he attracts more systems guys than
    language guys
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: after all, the #1 reason why any language ever
    has been adopted:
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it's the default language on some OS people
    wanted to use.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: C is better than Pascal but that's not why it

    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: to tomsyt-balsen
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: which was odd
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: ~tomsyt-balsen/try=>
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i ran a second chat
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and now i'm chatting from the second one
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and am getting atrocious terminal lag
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and yet still urbit refuses to die
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: this aint no soviet engineering
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: let's see if i can cause more mischief
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: success!
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: i got my sequence of flubs!
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: the bugs is fscking reproducible
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: let's try to reproduce it again
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: am now in a second chat on the phantom tomsyt
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: which has eaten my sub
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: now i do a ctrl-d ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" is in
    the building
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i get my flubs
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and then a ctrl-w stops the flubbing
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: fascinating
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i can't wait to hear cgy explain this one
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: if i had to guess, it's that running a phantom
    chat on the second ship
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: looks like the same process to incoming packets
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: but looks like a different process to outgoing
    packets
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: so i kill the second process
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: on the phantom ship
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and i get %time-lost until i switch away
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: but the interesting thing is that i still get
    filesystem events from the submarine
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: hang on, i'm gonna try to run a program on the
    sub
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: it works!
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: my submarine is now my neighbor
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: even though i can no longer get on it
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i vaguely recall someone finding this bug at
    some point in the past
    ~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: tomsyt: i can't say I've read everything you
    said but that all happened to me yesterday
    ~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: ^w made the flums go away
    ~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: etc
    ~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: *flubs
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and ^w sets it off
    ~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: working on a submarine, I was trying to see
    if I could get it to join :~novrud-hanweb/try=/bin/chat
    ~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: when I tried a sub that didn't have another
    ship in the pier, it worked
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: that's peculiar, innit?
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: all i can say for certain is that something,
    somewhere is getting confused
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i'll ask cgy about it
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: although he'll probably see my giant wall of
    text next time he's on
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i'd apologize for spamming, but the urbiverse
    has been quiet today
    ~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: the store and forward architecture is going
    to help me get over my addiction to hackernews
    ~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: here, there is no illusion that I can or
    should read everything
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: ...I read everything
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: but then again, i suppose that that's my job
    ~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: that's great, I can't even find time to
    finish reading the hoon docs
    ~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: I just fixed a ruby thing though
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: what sort of ruby thing?
    ~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: there's this mechanize script that worked
    with mint.com up til a few days ago
    ~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: mint-exporter
    ~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: to log you in and download a CSV of all your
    transactions
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: but what would one do with said CSV?
    ~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: looks like they made everything very
    javascripty without any user-visible difference
    ~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: mechanize doesn't work anymore
    ~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: use it to reconcile (say) a ledger
    ~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: it's very hard to get data out of mint.com
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: are there mint competitors that let you import
    csvs?
    ~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: there's no API, they don't want one
    ~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: <-
    ~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: not a competitor so much as beeminder
    integration
    ~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: working on it
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: this is one of the pain points we here in the
    urbiverse are trying to solve
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: all your mint data should live in your home
    folder
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: or rather main/lib
    ~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: well a ledger is one of those things that's
    kind of hard to do with the variability of data
    ~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: mint does a pretty good job with showing you
    the balance of cash accounts
    ~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: but there's often no transaction to show when
    the balance goes down
    ~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: I feel like I should have a page that shows
    me a red light for each pending transaction that hasn't been recorded yet
    ~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: since it's one of the things that each
    different bank probably does differently
    ~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: M&T Bank does a crappy job of delivering the
    news for instance
    ~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: I suspect
    ~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: but anyway the mint-exporter with
    capybara-webkit support is up, if I knew how to use capybara correctly it would
    be awesome but it works
    ~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]:

    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: test
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": John you fixed that nasty -- problem in markdown... nice
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: https://github.com/Katee/quietnet
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: yeah that hephep problem was annoying
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: apparently github flavoured markdown interprets
    -- as a horizontal rule
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: even though the md specs say that an <hr> is
    three heps
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: and even inside of a code block
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: so i had to use GHMD's code block fencing syntax
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: n.b. quietnet is a chat program that uses
    no sockets or bluetooth connections of any kind
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: which maruku on my laptop doesn't process
    properly
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": at least there was an easy workarond
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": i'm surprised that hoon syntax doesn't cause more
    problems with markdown!
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: except now i have to put changes on the web
    before i can see whether they worked or not
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: but it's fine
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: i'm just griping
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: you'd think that having raised $100m, GH would
    have its shit together
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: does gfm use redcarpet still?~racbes-solmun "kpm" is in the building
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: evening, ~racbes-solmun
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": good evening
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": tonight's stupidity excuse: head cold
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] empathizes
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: that is, I am also using that as a
    stupidity excuse
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": in reality, I have no more excuses
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": I have a hoon repl on a local machine
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": and three whole chapters of doc
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": but also more distractions than there were up on the
    mountain
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": and a head cold.
    ~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: why is the rum gone
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: i also have a head cold
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: which is making this process of grokking edwards
    curves more annoying than it should be
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: fortunately i also have tomato soup
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] empathizes re distractions
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: turns out there's a bunch of stuff going
    on in the city
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: drastic difference from that one day I
    kept living for most of last year!
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: hey, man you only do two days
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: the day you enter
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: and the day you leave
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] hums Cosmic Charlie
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSXm4FUmE5g
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: i love the wire
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: quite confident that people will still be
    watching the wire
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: long after baltimore ceases to exist
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: which, at present trends...
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": hmm. i am receiving every chat message twice.
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: that sounds like a problem
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: that sounds like a problem
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: >_>
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: ctrl-x cycles through processes. if you
    ctrl-x twice and see two '&'s, ctrl-d on one of them
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: if not, I defer to ~bilsym-bisner
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": aha. i think i'm good now.
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": Probably hit ctrl-x out of emacs reflex.
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] nods
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: I suppose one day we will have an emacs
    urbit mode
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: we may also have an urbit emacs mode, but
    that one frightens me ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE" has left the building
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": gnu emacs needs to die
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": as son as possible
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: write us an editor in hoon!
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": hoon can't be any more confusing and uncomfortable
    than elisp
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: in my experience, it is until it isn't
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": (I speak as a loyal emacs user and elisp author of
    15 years)
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: of course, my experience is atypical.
    most people will learn Hoon from comprehensive, friendly docs. I learned Hoon
    as koan practice.  ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] is in the
    building ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE" is in the building
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": hmm. what are all these %flub %time-lost messages
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: if you scroll back up the chat log, i have
    involved journey through the time-lost flubs
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: *an involved ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen)
    Wolfe-Pauly] has left the building
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: basically, don't hit ctrl-w
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: it causes flubs
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: but if you do get flubbed
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: ctrl-w fixes it
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: it's very strange
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: of course, if you haven't hit ctrl-w,
    this might bear further investigation
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] approves of "lul" as an abbreviation for
    ++ ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] is in the building
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": luslus is for teh lulz?
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": i did hit C-w
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": i guess that falls under "doctor doctor, it hurts
    when I do this"
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": Anyway re broken destroyer, I did copy my passphrase
    over from .urbit
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": what's the deal with the entropy entered for :begin
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": if I recreate my pier and get that wrong, what would
    the symptoms be?
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: you wouldn't be able to create your
    destroyer
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: you also wouldn't be able to create your
    destroyer if you got it right, at the moment...
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": ha
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: recreating destroyers within a continuity
    era is coming soon
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: or rather ownership transfers
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: the flub should be salvageable, though --
    have you gotten it?
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": okay. i've got a different destroyer that i haven't
    been able to get working recently
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": let me try ot restart it and i'll pastebin the log~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short] is in the building
    ~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: hello, is this on
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: sorta
    ~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: huh. well that works now
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": oh. it half works.
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": it can send but not receive. curious.
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: which destroyer?
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": ~malmec-libsev ~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]
    has left the building
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: aha. it can't receive? that's surprising.

    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": but = doesn't
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": ok i hit C-d in that one but we don't get a leave
    notification. wacky ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" has left the building
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: are you still flubbing?
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": no flubs, here or there ~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash)
    Short] has left the building
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: puzzling.
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": see http://bpaste.net/show/rqqwFwUJofwUssRmnIrT/
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": :update just hangs at [waiting...] until C-d
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: you have john and I flubbergasted. can
    you drydock that pier and send it to curtis?
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": sure, how do I do that :)
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: tar czf mypier.tar.gz mypier
    urb/$mydestroyer urb/$mysub ~/.urbit/$mypassfile
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": ah. I thought 'drydock' might involve
    exporting/modifying stuff :)
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: well, it does. just not in urbit. :-p
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": heh heh
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: also don't run that pier after you send
    it in, of course
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": i could see that causing problems yes.
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: two instances of the same pier running on
    the network will do strange and terrible things ~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash)
    Short] is in the building
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": couldn't resist one last try before packing it off.
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE":  now :hi ~zod succeeds but still no receipt in :chat
    or :update
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE"  tars it up
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: I am starting to vaguely suspect that
    you're just dealing with some sort of network delay
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": well
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": both piers are on the same network, just different
    hosts 
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": and it worked on that host a few days ago~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short] has left the building
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: hmm
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: well, in any case, send it in and we'll
    see what we can come up with

    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]:  good morning peoples
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": hail!
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: curious to see some of these bugs reported
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I guess malmec-libsev was messing around with
    ^W, huh
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a rather dangerous pastime in the present state
    of things...
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": too bad :chat can't east the ^W since that seems to be
    the only time there is an issue
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": *eat*
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that would be a very bruceacious way of fixing
    it :-)
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": not a fix... just a way to get by until it gets fixed
    properlty
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": i've been cured of ^W myself ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm" is in
    the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but no, it gets processed by batz first and we
    need it in other places
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": of course ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm" has left the building
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": hey, nobody said it was dangerous... :)
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I did somewhere in a cellar with a "beware of
    the leopard" sign on the door
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": ah, of course.
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": what's next to get documented? web services? (hint hint)
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: plenty more language doc is on the way
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: web services are great of course but some arvo
    level cleanup is necessary as well
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we'll probably do a simultaneous doc and
    cleanup at this level
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but there are a few more chapters of language
    doc ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] is in the building ~talsur-todres [Galen
    (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] is in the building
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": the last one was very helpful but got a bit challenging
    towards the end! e.g.
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": [%brdt *]  [%brcn (~(put by *(map term foot)) %$ [%ash
    p.gen])]
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": i know... obvious to the average peasant..~dilnem-nodfun "cmm" is in the building ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm" has left the
    building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes all we're doing in that line is putting the
    foot in the core with a name of $
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: probably should be less intimidating than it is
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": a foot of ash...  ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" has left the
    building ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm" is in the building
    ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm": what is obvious to the average peasant is deadly to the
    average pheasant
    ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm": gosh, look at the time ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm" has left the
    building ~ravweb-holber "akkartik" is in the building ~ravweb-holber "akkartik"
    has left the building ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" is in the building ~tasfyn-partyv
    [Curtis Yarvin] has left the building ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is in the
    building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] looks at the time
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hatteb, do you have the skinny on that slow
    destroyer?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the time is ~2014.1.13..19.12.01..9ffd
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: just so ya know
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] assumes everyone is reading chapter 7 with
    savage assiduous diligence
    ~hiddem-lomder "atax3a": performance goes in and out, really. sometimes it
    works great, but when it's processing a large bolus of data (like :chat
    backlog)
    ~hiddem-lomder "atax3a": it goes to pot.  ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" has left the
    building ~hiddem-lomder "atax3a" has left the building ~hiddem-lomder "atax3a"
    is in the building
    ~hiddem-lomder "atax3a": top says it's in kqread state, most of the time.~dilnem-nodfun "cmm" is in the building ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm" has left the
    building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] doesn't know kqread state off the top of his
    head.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: he does know his interpreter isn't the fastest
    thing in the world
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the chat backlog involves a bunch of
    interpreted things - interpreted printing, interpreted network protocol...
    ~hiddem-lomder "atax3a": kqread is in the bowels of libuv, most likely. I'll
    just blame interpreter inefficiency for the time being.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: also, "goes to pot" doesn't mean what you think
    it means, I don't think
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes it's almost certainly a waiting state
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: what exactly happened?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hm, doznec paused oddly for a moment
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] will blame Digital Ocean inefficiency for that
    ~hiddem-lomder "atax3a": it pauses oddly, and consumes all of its time on a
    single CPU. :) ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] has left the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: when does it pause oddly?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] pauses evenly.
    ~hiddem-lomder "atax3a": it pauses oddly, but i cannot correlate it with any
    time in particular.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] finds this bug report unsatisfying.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] finds your lack of specificity disturbing.
    ~hiddem-lomder "atax3a": it does seem to be related to the network, though. i
    can get it to brifly eat a CPU by chatting, apparently.
    ~hiddem-lomder "atax3a": Argh!
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: briefly as in 1 sec, 2 sec, 10 sec, 0.1 sec?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] remains quietly present.
    ~hiddem-lomder "atax3a": briefly as in between 1 and 2 seconds.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: odd.  what exactly do you do to make it do it/
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: each chat, it pauses for 1-2 sec?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has some old profiling code in there which has
    decayed from disuse./ ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm" is in the building
    ~hiddem-lomder "atax3a": it does not pause for every chat.
    ~hiddem-lomder "atax3a": it pauses for many chats, but sometimes it pauses with
    the &... prompt.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the pause with &... means you're waiting for~doznec
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it really shouldn't pin the cpu
    ~hiddem-lomder "atax3a": Is there anything I can do from inside Arvo to help
    diagnose this?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: not really at present, because profiling is not
    live
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is surprising that &... would pin the cpu
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: or that something that happens then would pin
    the cpu
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: because literally, &... is just the state of
    "I've said something to :room but haven't heard anything back yet"
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: what are your feelings about ktrace,
    atax3a?
    ~hiddem-lomder "atax3a": It could just be false correlation on my part.
    ~hiddem-lomder "atax3a" can ktrace this, sure.  ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" is in the
    building
    ~hiddem-lomder "atax3a" is, in fact, ktracing. As we speak. And it just paused
    before the "as".
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: oh goodie
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: peculiar indeed
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I've never seen anything like this
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] suspects that hiddem's computer has gone to pot.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: an expression first recorded in 1662, I'll have
    you know
    ~hiddem-lomder "atax3a": It could be my machine - this is in a jail on ZFS,
    which is a nonstandard configuration squared.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] wouldn't be surprised if this is interacting
    oddly with the checkpoint fsync
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it also could be the gc, which runs every 5
    seconds whether we need it or not (we should never need it)
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is still looking for that 28-byte leak, which
    appeared mysteriously when satfex fixed all the other leaks
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: >_>
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is sure that's just a coincidence though.
    ~hiddem-lomder "atax3a": hm. i'm not getting  filesync events either.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that bug sometimes pops up with non-ZFS
    filesystems as well
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] does not entirely trust either libuv, or the
    linux kernel, or his own code in this matter
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] can't wait for a couple of interns to show up
    this summer so he can send them into a greasy hole with vague instructions'
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: like "go to system software hell and come back
    with why I'm not getting my inotify events"
    ~hiddem-lomder "atax3a": That's not even vague.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: not as vague as it could be, but it assumes a
    determination to do battle with whatever orcs may be encountered ~dilnem-nodfun
    "cmm" has left the building ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] is in
    the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] goeth to lunch
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] has battled enough orcs that he is
    starting to notice a certain orc-like structure to his reflection~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] has left the building
    ~hiddem-lomder "atax3a" forgot to include timestamp information in the first
    kdump. Augh.  ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has left the building~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" has left the building ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen)
    Wolfe-Pauly] has left the building
    ~hiddem-lomder "atax3a": testing 1 2 3 4 3 2 1?
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": yes, hi.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": hard to decouple network latency from vere latency~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is in the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it requires better toolage than we have~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] is in the building
    ~hiddem-lomder "atax3a": So, if I send in ktrace.out files, would anyone be
    able to read them? Or should I kdump them beforehand?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I'm anything but an experienced ktrace user...
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: really the main question is whether you're
    spending your time inside nock or not
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you should be able to see this relatively
    easily
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we are not instrumented to add urbit traces to
    the ktrace trace ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] has left the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is assuming that ktrace is something like
    dtrace, which can thus be instrumented ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] is in the
    building
    ~hiddem-lomder "atax3a": ktrace is more like strace - not an instrumentable
    thing, just a syscall-boundary scanner.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: got it, but at least it tells you whether
    you're in user or kernel mode
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I assume
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: reminder, we have a chat meeting tomorrow nite
    at 7pm PST
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Important Things will be discussed
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this has been your friendly local reinder
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: reminder
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: also, we have an IRL meetup next monday
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: in san francisco
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]:
    http://www.eventbrite.com/e/urbit-bay-area-meetup-tickets-10153755155
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" , astoundingly, should be able to make that, somehow.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: no tickets required, it's just a bar~dilnem-nodfun "cmm" is in the building ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen)
    Wolfe-Pauly] is in the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] wishes it would rain sometime, he's getting
    tired of beautiful California winter weather ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm" has left the
    building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] just pushed an update to chapter 7
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: chapter 8 is coming sooner than you know...~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" is in the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hang on, we got a page build failure
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Dr. Jekyll is Mr. Hyde all the time
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you will never ever catch me releasing a
    product which tells you there's a syntax error, BUT NOT WHICH LINE
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] 's idea of what Jekyll can do with itself are
    graphic, profound and unprintable
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" once used a product whose config-parse error was "YOUR
    JSON IS BAD AND YOU SHOULD FEEL BAD".
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]  has strong feelings about this whole era of
    Wiffle Software
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that's at least funny
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": I call it clownshoes garbage.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that's good too
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Coffeescript is probably better than Jekyll but
    I still feel the same way about it
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hint, if you can build Rome in a day, it's
    probably not a very good Rome
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] 's current feeling about the "Markdown family of
    standards" revolves around the Todd Haynes film _Poison_
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a very arty late-80s homoerotic take on the
    important sociopolitical issue of prison rap[e
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] doesn
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] doesn't really see Markdown on the top in this
    scene.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: tomsyt-balsen just discovered that the GFM
    examples on Github's own page don't render properly.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the "M" in GFM stands for "Markdown," it is
    totally false that the "G" is for "Goats.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: actually the specific tool at fault here seems
    to be something called Maruku
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which I think is an Albanian word for what you
    do if you want to get married, but only have a goat.  ~rovrel-bicmyl has left
    the building ~rovrel-bicmyl is in the building ~rovrel-bicmyl has left the
    building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is still struggling with Markdown.  The goats
    may be winning.
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: markdown is only mildly annoying
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: gh pages is a fscking nightmare
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: their parsing is sloppy as hell
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: but I've solved it, mostly
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and now i just feel dirty
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: okay, the latest and greatest chapter 7 is now
    posdted
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: thanks to considerable effort from
    tomsyt-balsen
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" likes the updates so far.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] prefers natural hoons to synthetic hoons.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": This seems a bit like classifying a book on Urbit into
    a fiction/nonfiction axis.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ultimately it matters because the way you
    really know hoon is to know ++ut, the compiler
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so the difference between synthetic/macro hoons
    and ones that are implemented directly
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: is that you have to actually understand the
    natural (direct) hoons, whereas you can just look the others up
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ++ut is less than 2kloc so it should be more or
    less knowable...
    ~hiddem-lomder "atax3a" is admittedly scared of strings like
    p.i.t.t.p.i.t.p.u.may
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this is what the alias feature is there to fix
    ~hiddem-lomder "atax3a": Also, I see that fink:ut and finq:ut have the same
    sigfas. intentional?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ooh, just a sec
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes, there is actually no jet for finq - it
    shouldn't have a sigfas at all
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": I meant to asm
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": no I meant to ask, (freudian slip there)
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": is someone a _Total Annihilation_ player
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": ("core" and "arm" were the names of the two factions
    in that game.)
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: heh, not at all
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a shared love for short words, I guess~satnum-maptux "yebyen" is in the building ~hiddem-lomder "atax3a" has left the
    building ~hiddem-lomder "atax3a" is in the building ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen" has

    building ~satnum-maptux "yebyen" has left the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] reminds everyone that we have a meeting tomorrow
    at 7PM PST (~2014.1.15..03.00.00)
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ie, 3 AM GMT, more or less.
