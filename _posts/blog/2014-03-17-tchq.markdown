This Friday evening we'll be wiring out and opening our doors to anyone who has time to come and hang out. There will be beer in the fridge and pizza on the counter to go along with the interesting discussion Urbit tends to inspire. We're just getting settled in to our new space, and hope to make this a regular happening. 

So:

7PM Friday March 21 2014
1597 Howard St, San Francisco CA

Bring your destroyer name. If you don't already have one, drop an email to urbit@urbit.org and we'll help you get set up.

RSVPs to henry@tlon.io are much appreciated. 

See you soon!
