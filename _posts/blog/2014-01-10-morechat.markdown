Urbit, `~2014.1.10`:

    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": :room stays up
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": if you can fix it by cloning chat.hoon, i'll read
    about it later :D
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen" has left the building
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": from the tweeters: <bascule> [32] Raft consensus
    visualized:
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": <http://thesecretlivesofdata.com/raft/>
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Thank you for that site, ~hatteb-mitlyd.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Does raft encounter many long-term race conditions in
    practice? Even in the toy example of network partitioning, it seemed to take a
    long time to elect a leader.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" is unsure. e's only ever encountered Raft in theory.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Test
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": %tost
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": doznec is a clingy neighbor
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": even Mr. Rogers only insisted approx. daily
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm" has left the building
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm" is in the building
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": freshly :reset, no problems
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": hey tasfyn, might i get push access to the doc repo
    directly? or should i just push PRs?
    ~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: :hi ~zod
    ~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: oops not here, heh
    ~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short] is in the building
    ~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short] has left the building
    ~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short] is in the building
    ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm" is in the building
    ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm" has left the building
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" has left the building
    ~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short] has left the building
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm" has left the building
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm" is in the building
    ~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short] is in the building
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT" is in the building
    ~bitmet-racteg "IMT" is in the building
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm" has left the building
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": 
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm" is in the building
    ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm" is in the building
    ~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: is :update a thing i should expect to
    work? because it's telling me "main failed to merge" and "arvo failed to merge"
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": ":update" should work, but is (iirc) known to be
    "fragile".  Not sure if that helps.  CGY or John B. should be consulted.
    ~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: okay. well if i'm receiving chat messages
    I will take that as a sign nothing is too broken and stop worrying.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": malmec-libsev, have you manually altered any of the
    files in arvo or main? That caused merge failures for me as well.
    ~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short] has left the building
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm" has left the building
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] is in the building
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: :update should work
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: unless you've made changes to your directory
    tree
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: merging still pretty much sucks
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: figure out where the merge conflicts are and
    just fix it manually
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: that should probably work
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" is in the building
    ~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short] is in the building
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm" is in the building
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] has left the building
    ~lapled-rammyn [Jordan Lewis] is in the building
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] is in the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is in the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: :update is indeed fragile
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it awaits an OS cleanup pass, similar to what I
    just did on hoon
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but documentation is coming first
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the right way to (try to) fix your merge
    problems is to git pull, then cp -r from urb/zod
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen" is in the building
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": Hail hail, there's a new ~novrud-hanweb/try/ desk
    again, I forgot to add the '?' doc
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: excellent
    ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm" has left the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I like that people are actually using the
    filesystem...
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: also btw, the current auction bid is 10BTC
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that one will probably stick I suspect...
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": :ls / ~novrud-hanweb/try/
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": oops
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": 
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: /try=/ or some other version
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": I think I asked this before but don't recall seeing an
    answer -- is anyone running their destroyer(s) on cloud based hosts?
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": Like amazon ecc etc.?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: actually I think most people are
    ~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: interesting
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: certainly zod and doznec are on digital ocean
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: well, I don't know about most people
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": i was for a bit but without web access to chat and the
    command line it doesn't have much advantage i found
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": and i'm not running a server that anyone else is
    depending on
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": Is there a "howto" for folks who wanna try but don't have
    the time to figure out the details?
    ~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short] has left the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: to run on amazon?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the directions on urbit.org should be
    sufficient if you can get an instance going
    ~bitmet-racteg "IMT": yeah, it's the "getting an instance going" part I
    specifically wanted to avoid learning too much about.  :-)
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: getting a droplet on DO is maybe a 3 step
    process
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: very easy
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: aws is somewhat more complicated
    ~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short] is in the building
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": What's the min-cost of a DO instance?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: $5 a month.  We're paying 10 I think
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": Interesting.  Another question: I've got a couple of
    beagleboards lying around, arm processors, run ubuntu.  Any reason why urbit
    will obviously fail on a arm processor?
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": Also these look interesting: http://cubox-i.com/
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": Urbit should be architecture-independent. I think some
    intrepid souls have gotten it running on Mandroid devices.
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": That was my belief, but I thought it possible I was
    missing something.
    ~labtud-machep [Steven Dee] is in the building
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": I like the idea of having a continuously running
    instance, and I like the idea of a portable physical instance too, although I'm
    not sure I can justify the latter.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the difficulty with urbit on low end machines
    is that if they die, your ship loses continuity
    ~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short] has left the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but labtud-machep over here is working on Raft
    so you can have a cluster of them
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ideally a Beowulf cluster...
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" experiences unwelcome fasdot fasbcks.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there was a time when /.  didn't suck, at least
    not that much
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": OK. Yeah, as long as the media is extractable from the
    "low end instance" I should be able to get the instance running again, right?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: maybe, maybe not - it depends on whether you
    have committed everything before computing and responding to it
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: urbit is not terribly great at this at the
    moment
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but then you don't have any mission-critical
    data in urbit I hope :-)
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": Sure.  but that could happen on any machine, right, given
    a crash.
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": Not just yet.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" keeps all of its missions in Urbit.
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": I don't even have a mission, for that matter.
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" has left the building
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": But I have plans.  No one knows my plan.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": Oh dang I think I have to recreate the :thumb which
    read a .plan from the thumbee.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it could.  but it is more likely to because our
    present prototype doesn't pay much attention to ACID
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" may be able to restore it from backups...
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": I unthinkingly blew away my $URBIT_HOME. How
    thoughtless of me.
    ~labtud-machep [Steven Dee]: yeah I have a local Beowulf cluster going on my
    portable laptop thin client terminal machine
    ~labtud-machep [Steven Dee]: it's running all of Raft except the useful part
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": Beowulf cluster under vm's running on your laptop, or do
    you have LFB (Little Farm of Boards) of yer own?
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": Raft, I know not.
    ~labtud-machep [Steven Dee]: actually not even VMs
    ~labtud-machep [Steven Dee]: well vere is a VM, right?
    ~labtud-machep [Steven Dee]: so I'm running a bunch of veres
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": vere is a real VM
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": as opposed to all of those fake ones that virtualize
    x86_64 with hardware assistance
    ~labtud-machep [Steven Dee]: vere, putting the V in VM
    ~labtud-machep [Steven Dee]: VVM
    ~labtud-machep [Steven Dee]: the extra V stands for VYOVV
    ~bitmet-racteg "IMT": Nice try, sonny, but it's turtles all the way down.
    ~labtud-machep [Steven Dee]: until you get to the badgers
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": easiest way to distinguish rooms seems to be to use
    tis to find residents.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: heh
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is distressed to think that all the cool kids
    are over in yebyen's room.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: at least he can post logs.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": i keep _almost_ forgetting that :room buffers
    messages, so i can't miss anything.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: unless the whole :room dies
    ~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short] is in the building
    ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm" is in the building
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": Is the w3c serious about letting the MPAA in?
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": The oldweb has this surreal parody aspect to it, more
    often than not.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: why shouldn't they be?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: exactly...
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the oldweb was dead to me when popup blocking
    in browsers just kind of stopped working.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" used to cry 'death to the http monoculture', and then
    it got all Snowd'in.
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" is in the building

    ~sivbud-barnel [Bruce Schwartz] is in the building
    ~sivbud-barnel [Bruce Schwartz]: hello all on the other side of the breach
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": I've always been on this side of the breach...
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: updated and reset, I feel so
    fresh
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" has left the building
    ~macmud-taprut is in the building
    ~sarlug-picwep "ikari" has left the building
    ~todnym-nathes is in the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: :reset always gives you that fresh feeling
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] uses hand sanitizer as deodorant, it leaves him
    feeling ineffably fresh
    ~wacdyr-ripwes is in the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: :ticket `@p`0xdddd.0100
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: doh
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": Is C-w still flaky, tasfyn?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes :-)
    ~todnym-nathes has left the building
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" avoids.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: who owns sarlug-picwep?  it seems to be
    misbehaving...
    ~talmul-noswed is in the building
    ~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short] has left the building
    ~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short] is in the building
    ~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short] has left the building
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" has left the building
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" is in the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is actually working on the doc for once
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" looks forward to it.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] looks sideways at it.
    ~wacdyr-ripwes has left the building
    ~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short] is in the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: macmud added forward-word and backward-word
    (M-F and M-B) to dill
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": that will help my middle-aged emacs fingers out a bit.
    ~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: i was just missing those, myself
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] has left the building
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4" has left the building
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": I'd read the article you linked, dash, but the URL
    appears to say it all.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has left the building
    ~talmul-noswed has left the building
    ~macmud-taprut: huh, vere acts pretty funny if you switch the order of _lo_boot
    and _lo_init
    ~macmud-taprut: (note, I don't advise this)
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": funny ha-ha, or funny "there is a fish in my coffee"?
    ~macmud-taprut: the latter
    ~macmud-taprut: 2 cuil funny, you might say
    ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm" has left the building
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: So I hear Urbit failed because
    nobody has implemented strip poker in it within someone else's time frame
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": where did you hear that?
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": oldwebz
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": source of all truth
    ~sivbud-barnel [Bruce Schwartz] has left the building
    ~sivbud-barnel [Bruce Schwartz] is in the building
    ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm" is in the building
    ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm" has left the building
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: From the guy who's partnered with
    Stanislav to sell secure hardware
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Also, another writer I've never
    heard of calls Urbit "the current epitome of the 'toy boat startup'"
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: A definite compliment in that
    context
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" had a friend lovingly say that Urbit could become the
    next Smalltalk.
    ~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: smalltalk wasn't perfect but it was a
    definite improvement on most of its successors
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": it's a pity that the smalltalk implementation most of
    us use is literally a child's toy
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": made by Apple and Disney in a joint. venture.
    ~bitmet-racteg "IMT": q:(slap !>(.) (rain ~ '(add 2 3)'))
    ~bitmet-racteg "IMT": doh.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": insufficent hax
    ~bitmet-racteg "IMT": No, twas not my intent to send the message "5" to
    everyone. :-)
    ~bitmet-racteg "IMT" q:(slap !>(.) (rain ~ '(add 2 3)')) 5
    ~bitmet-racteg "IMT": Cool.
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] is in the building
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: *whew
    ~macmud-taprut: a bathtub is a reasonable proving ground for an aircraft
    carrier design
    ~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: Pretty sure Kay would tell us that we
    should be able to use more things that are children's toys
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" has this RSA SecurID that reads only '3'
    ~sivbud-barnel [Bruce Schwartz] has left the building
    ~sivbud-barnel [Bruce Schwartz] is in the building
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": Greetings!

    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] is in the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the toy boat startup!
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I could be a toy boat startup, whee
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": everyone i know thinks Urbit is academic performance
    art...
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the "toy boat startup" guy is Paul Sawaya, I
    think Burnham knows him
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that famo.us thing is cool too!
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] is in the building
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm" has left the building
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: hey guys, a funny thing happened on the
    way to the :chat
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: when I searched for my ticket, gmail
    asked me: "Did you mean: satfix-diddy"
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: loves autocorrect
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] thinks urbit names need a canonical
    pronunciation though
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: perhaps in a future continuity error
    that'll be my nickname
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: continuity era
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: :-|
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: S-Diddy?
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": S-diddy and the partyvan
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] thinks "tasfyn-partyv" needs to rhyme with
    "that's fine part hive"
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: otherwise the ambiguous schwa rules all
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: actually name pronunciation merits some
    less-un-serious thought at some point
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: indeed it does
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" just pronounces it with as neutral of an accent as 'e
    can manage.
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: one guy in particular was pretty curious
    about it
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: one is always overly surprised to meet a
    "cousin" differing by only one syllable
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but statistically this will be pretty darn
    common
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: birthday effect and all that
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: your mind has to learn to disambiguate
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: as it already does with common English names
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": Laura, Lauren.
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Any thoughts on timetable for
    ACL's, even as proof of concept? Or is the idea to delay Stallman's nightmare
    of the choice for data segregation as long as possible?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that needs to come in as part of our
    forthcoming arvo design/cleanup pass
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it will probably still be preliminary but a
    little smarter
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: obviously "everyone can read everyone else's
    files" is not an acceptable permanent solution
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] is not sure that "extant" is smarter than
    the alternative
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: (like most of what I say, that was not
    intentionally Zen)
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: no, but it was intentionally confusing?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] did not recall saying "extant," or even
    "sextant..."
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": atax1a, you are lucky, I only know two people who even
    half understand Urbit or care to try
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that's an ideal position to be in - too cool
    for school
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the basic problem is that the technology is
    wildly overkill for the problem it can actually solve right now - ie, chat
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: the joke was that we currently don't have
    ACLs
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but once we get to the point where we start
    killing other things
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: anterior cruciate ligament?
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: although I realize that we sort of do,
    just not really
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is still confused
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: although, we do have ACLs in that you can only
    get %cx from other ships
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: or %c*, rather
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but what you can't do is go in and dereference
    their private keys
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] fears the day that urbit develops anterior
    cruciate ligaments
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: unless they can get you to run their programs
    over the network
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: be very afraid of yebyen's little chat program,
    he has that lean and hungry look
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] does not run other people's programs on zod or
    doznec, at least not until he has an anterior cruciate ligament.
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": yeah I only needed to change about 12 characters to
    make my own channel
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: it would be smart to keep estimates on
    time-to-sentience for various computer-related thingies
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Easier than making your own
    Bitcoin clone
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: fortunately we can see the source, so we know
    whether you stole our keys
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": I'll continue to publish my desk number
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": ship/desk/...
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is just joking, really
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": i can't remember what it's called
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we're all friends here.  until we're not
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": imrowan, do you know I made bitcrapd?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you can use :label, btw, to actually give it a
    label...
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Just to see what would happen the
    other day I ran :pope and got actual output that looked like a non-error, of
    course all the carrier names are already determined
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": before it was cool to make bitcoin clones
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I was not aware of that
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it's one thing to run :pope, another to be the
    pope...
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]  finds the pope's hat pretty heavy sometimes
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": I really enjoy the feature of testnet coins, that if
    nobody mines for so long... the difficulty goes back to minimum
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": it's something like an uptime guarantee
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Heavy lies the head that wears
    the hat
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": "caught me?  have some free *coins to cover for me!"
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: yebyen, *g* is actually being
    unhelpful. Colour me surprised.
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": what?
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": I am so helpful :)
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I'm trying to not-name Sergey's
    Frankenstein, for the opposite reason that I usually type G-d
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": you mean Mr. Bitcoin Satosh
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": I win! yay 
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: If I knew how to program I would
    make the next Google-That-Does-Not-Suck
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: It would aggregate G* results
    with everything else, then strip out the irrelevant spam that G* now provides
    two and three of just to make you extra blood-pressury

    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": I might actually win enough to bid 10.3BTC on ~nyt
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": If anyone actually fires up their carrier, I kind of
    imagine they would come to ~doznec to announce it
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: perhaps
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": Someone is going to do it
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": So you are the zenmaster, who went to Germany?
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": Greetings! :) \/ ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan)
    Rowan]: It would be interesting to budget a carrier, but I'm unable to comply
    with the KYC requirement, and not in a moral or philosophical way. If I were
    truly ack'd stateless I could probably \/ find a way like Mr. Gogulski did.  \/
    \/
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: master? hardly, but I do recall being in
    Germany recently
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": I was very interested to find the nostate domain on
    the PHP "bitcoin library" after someone petitioned me to help them
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": build a Bitcoin casino...
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": Has anyone seen his Bitcoin PHP library? :)
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": Mr. Gogulski
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": They insisted it should be in PHP and MySQL
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": we did not talk again after that day.
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I was only familar with him
    through nostate, then one day I see he bought a carrier
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": I had never heard of nostate until he bought a carrier
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": Is it his blog, or is he on it because he has no
    state?
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": Incidentally, all of his backup documents were
    inaccessible to my get requests
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": I never saw his proof of not having any state
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": It sounded plausible, I think he probably has forfeit
    his passport and had it returned with all the pages punched
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": But I thought it was odd that Urbit folk said "I
    accept your documents" and each of his <img src had invalid attribs
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": And he's not here now, so not able to defend himself
    of course
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Heh, valid XML or GTFO
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I just tried myself, I can see
    the docs when I click on the images
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": OK, I believe you
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": I'm at a JuiceSSH terminal, I can't check
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": I win again!

    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: hey, I have at times been known to walk

    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: walking mindfully in this area means watching

    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": to me the urban Americans now appear as futuristic
    catsuit-clad Jetsonoid robohumans
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that's basically the state of things
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: if you don't count the loping orcs and
    shambling zombies
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: well I mean there's the basic
    poop-avoidance algorithm, but that doesn't take that many cycles. you give it
    say five out of every hundred moments and you're good.
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": next to whom I am sort of like a homeless person
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": (which I technically am)
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: really walking mindfully takes way more
    focus than that
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: any homeless person would scoff
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: where's your cart?  where's your needle

    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] thinks satfex is understanding the poop
    avoidance problem
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] means underestimating it
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: for one thing, it's not all a case of mounds.
    There are also plenty of smears.
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: okay. honestly?  you're never going to
    avoid all of the poop. I'm sorry.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: dog vs. human is also a big concern
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but it's true, DNA testing of the bottom of my
    shoes would reveal...
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: in other news, this raft implementation
    is giving me lots of ideas on how to not implement raft
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: at least it's not Greece, which has terrible
    problems with goat poop
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: looks like berries.  but, not berries.

    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] would rather hear how not to implement raft.
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: look upon my github repo and despair
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that's a very general complaint which probably
    applies to all github repos

    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" despairs of rather a lot, these days.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but not of the urbits hopefully!
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which are advancing at a great pace though it's
    not necessarily obvious
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": Urbit is what keeps me afloat in my rivers of despair,
    which may be a really sad thing for the outside world
    ~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: i use urbit as a motivational device for
    the new programmers i encounter on irc
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we can only create one small spot of order in a
    permanently disordered world
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but we have no order yet, all we have is the
    hope of order
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the promise of order
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but one of the premises of this entire
    adventure is that order creates its own support
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: men and women instinctively loathe chaos and
    crave order
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: even when they've been taught to love chaos and
    fear order...
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] thinks that a destroyer's cruiser should be

    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a lot of hilarity is due to the fact that I
    thought I could build a message layer without a session identifier
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it works pretty much sort of
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is trying to document mindfully.  or perhaps
    mindlessly.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: bex is one of those happy coincidences of
    naming that's just... right.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but they're not all like that
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] still thinks (lte 5 6) should be no and (lte 6
    5) should be yes
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: or maybe they should be curried?  but it would
    be an enormous pita
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: to change
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": that is not a yak i would want to approach.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: many sherpas are killed by yaks every year
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you'd change it gradually, you'd create a new
    arm that did it the new way
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and gradually shift users over to the new
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and then change the names back
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] does this kind of stuff all the time cuz he has
    a language written in itself
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yall should see what it takes to change hoon in
    hoon
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" hopes to see sometime.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you will, but it has already been substantially
    domesticated
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: what it took to make the first hoon in hoon...
    only I know and I don't even remember
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": I heard it required some watt.

    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: now to write aes and ed25519
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and we'll have our cryptosuiteb
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": is it fast enough to run without a jet?
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: eh, not really, no
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i mean you could
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and it'd be about as fast as the RSA we have now
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: but why not use the jet?
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: it' free..
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] has left the building
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": just curious... since the underlying stuff
    (muliplication, shifting) is already jetted

    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": wow, burnham
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": you get a piece of cheese for that
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": that's about... 1/15 of my cheesespace
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: heh heh
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hopefully it's goat cheese
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": Interesting!
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": cheese comes in %goat %sheep and
                                  %cow, but he can pick
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": I wish I'd brought some pieces of γίδα
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": pretty cool
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the ag department would probably confiscate
    them
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] once brought a bunch of magic mushrooms back
    from Japan in a jar full of miso
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: not among the smartest things he did in his 20s
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] doesn't think the miso was very good for the
    delicate chemicals anyway
    ~rigryx-sovrus "atax2a" did some pretty dumb things in the 20s.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hopefully the Kellogg-Briand pact wasn't one of
    them
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but I figured, who smuggles drugs in from
    Japan?
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne] is in the building
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": an airport security drone in the UK really wanted to take
    my cheese, but her boss wouldn't let her
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: at that time you could actually buy them on the
    street in Shibuya
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: some sense remains in the UK
    ~rigryx-sovrus "atax2a" smuggled cannabis out of Burning Man once. That was
    pretty dumb.
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: what
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": yeah, that was a mistake, 2
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": What, using sovrus, or doing the thing?
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" says, rhetorically.
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": that you had anything left to export
    ~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: The list of dumb things I did in my 20's would
    be lengthy.
    ~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: I'm pretty sure the statute of limitations
    hasn't expired on all of them.
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: speaking of being in my 20s,
    i'm gonna be in SF during the last week of february
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": I'll be in SJC for a perfectly normal convention in
    the middle of January
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] has left the building
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] has left the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] welcomes hatteb and all visitors to Tlon's
    offices, which are literally a stone's throw from *three* cannabis stores
    ~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: Q: what does one call an expression in Nock?
    ~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: Like *[1 2]
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you'd have to be a pretty good throw though...
    ~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: I'm calling it an expression, but didn't know
    if there wasn't a non-standar name for it.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a formula.  well, the 2 is the formula.
    *[subject formula]
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: formula, it's not just for your howling
    six-month-old
    ~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: Thanks!
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" is more interested in the Tlon than the herbary.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] once brought his three-day-old daughter to the
    pediatrician only to be told, "don't worry, but she's starving to death.  take
    her home and give her some formula."
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: "don't worry but"
    ~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: There's probably a better way to phrase that.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it's actually quite normal for them to lose
    10-15% of body weight in the first week
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: even if they don't get into your
    mushroom-flavored miso
    ~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: Still kind of alarming that it happens. 
    ~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: The weight loss, not the finding the shrooms.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: everything about the process is alarming.
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: anything biological is
    alarming
    ~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: And how.
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: things that aren't biological
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: are also often alarming

    ~talmul-noswed: and Boudreaux's Butt Paste comes to the rescue.
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: is that the real name of an
    actual product
    ~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: Totally is.
    ~talmul-noswed: in fact it is
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": you're not joking
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": he's not joking
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: woah
    ~talmul-noswed: http://www.buttpaste.com/
    ~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: Now that's alarming.
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i am actually laughing irl
    ~talmul-noswed: rumors that I smuggled magic mushrooms back from Shibuya in a
    jar of Butt Paste, however, are entirely unconfirmed.
    ~talmul-noswed: nosryl-tarpem has four kids, he probably has to train them to
    put Butt Paste on each other
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": free-choice Butt Paste in a special tray
    ~talmul-noswed suspects that nosryl-tarpem has a staff of Oompa-Loompas
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hey wait, I turned into talmul-noswed
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] needs to keep a firmer grip on who he is today
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: how did that go wrong
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: two windows
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: four virtual desktops
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: oh
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: yeah
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: enough destroyers to sink the entire island of
    Hawaii
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": Butt Paste fumes
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is going to have to check what happens when you
    have a thousand destroyers in the same chatroom
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] suspects that it would only take about 80 to
    bring ~doznec to its knees
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": what is the solution?  a bigger, taller doznec?  more
    doznecs?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a more optimized doznec.  possibly with better
    backoff on the pings.  and yes, bigger, taller
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a cruiser simply has to be able to control 2^16
    destroyers
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this is difficult with our poorly optimized
    interpreted protocol path
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but the LLVM interpreter is making good
    progress and we can always write a jet
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: 2^16 is a big number but not absolutely
    terrifying
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: what is the first absolutely
    terrifying power of 2
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: 1 ping a minute from 2^16 destroyers is 1000
    pings/second
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you ought to be able to process a ping in a
    millisecond, it aint doin that much
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: anything above 2^16 is terrifying :-)
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: ...  2^17
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: hmm
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there is also a lot of latent capacity to
    parallelize
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the ping should not have any side effects and
    not need to be saveed, it's just to keep the tunnel open
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": is a ping a card?
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": no, you just said
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is.  it becomes a packet which is a card
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": oh wait yes
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": but doesn't need to be saved?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but if the card has no effect on the state, it
    need not be saved
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": hmmm
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we can ignore the fact that it happened
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: simply compare the two nouns
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it's perfectly legit.  unlike a jar of miso
    stuffed with magic mushrooms.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which, fyi, don't taste very good plain, and
    even worse with miso
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: probably better than Butt Paste though.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": at least one is For Human Consumption
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] suspects that Butt Paste is probably not only
    nontoxic, but might even be tasty
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] the other day handed his son a childproof bottle
    of gummies and said, here, can you take the lid off?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: his intent was to show him that it's impossible
    to get into the vitamin gummies by himself.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] turned his back and in 3 seconds the lid was
    off, hmm
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: speaking of which, has to go put his kids in
    bed
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: good night everyone!  and welcome
    foptec-nacfed...

    make it to satnum-maptux
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": tasfyn-partyv: you still owe me -p
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": I have a feeling that's my issue, the restrictive
    firewall here (and crappy nat there)
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": about the best thing i can suggest at the moment is to
    :report on the ships in question...
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": and probably all the way up the routing hierarchy,
    from the one that's out of comms?
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": the worst expected behavior is that they both fall
    back to talking through ~doznec, I think
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": packets (:hi's) from ~novrud-hanweb just don't make it
    to ~satnum-maptux
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": one way comm in the other direction
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": I'm going to disco/recon, against my better judgement
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is in the building
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": Of course now that you're here, the problem is gone.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I do wish there was a guide to [arvo] routing
    uses
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] is in the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: naturally
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: issues
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I'm on a Starbucks connection, so surprised
    that anything routes
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": I did get a port in that magic range, which our
    firewall is willing to route
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": So that might be the reason it's working
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it might be but it shouldn't be necessary
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we should always route through zod if needed
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: as for A1 security...
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has always heard that these big books of
    requirements were appalling and bureaucratic
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] would like to be A1 secure but more in the sense
    of the steak sauce
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": mmm... steak
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: The spirit of A1 without the
    letter might be nice
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": We could always be %heinz57 secure

    reason?  it really blows performance-wise on this tegra3 quad-core, and...
    ~divsem-misdef "xulrunner42": at the same time it seems to be using only one
    core, the rest of the system is pretty much unusable...
    ~divsem-misdef "xulrunner42": I swear performance was a lot better on a dual
    core tegra2
    ~divsem-misdef "xulrunner42" has left the building
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": it runs well enough on my intelish platforms...
    ~divsem-misdef "xulrunner42" is in the building
    ~divsem-misdef "xulrunner42": yeah it runs fantastically on my quad-core

    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": And, so, I'm gathering from reading %eyre, the ^-(unit
    httr) in deft means it's returning [ ~ (deaf ...)]?
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne] is in the building
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Performance only suffers when I
    paste something in still, probably unavoidable to some extent as every
    character is an event
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": atax1a, my understanding is that (unit httr) is either ~
    or [ ~ httr]
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": so basically deft return either null or an httr

    ~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: err.. TF700T

    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes, (unit httr) is either ~ or [ ~ httr]
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: sorry for not chatting today, we were

    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: "every time I think I'm out... they suck me
    back in!"
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: what is sand hil lroad
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham] is in the building
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: sand hill road is where the venture capital is
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: it's almost a metonym
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: like wall street for finance
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: or the pentagon for the us military

    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": hey admiral, what is the meaning of !:?
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": we're in ~novrud-hanweb discussing the subject
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": THE SUBJECT, the most significant mystery of all
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": and shorthand tree addressing
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": so if -< means "left child of subject"
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": what is the subject
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": I don't even know anymore
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": no man
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": - means head
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": + means tail
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": < head > tail
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": so -< ought to mean tail of head
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": - is *a* subject
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": but in batz you can also say +
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": that's the tail
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: the whole noun is .
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": oh boy you're right
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": mercy, mercy, I can't anymore, I'm leaving the other
    :room
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": and I'm wrong
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": whew, only one &
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": yes, back to ~doznec
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": that's worth like half a chicken right there
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: afaik !: enables tracing, but don't quote
    me...
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": sounds like a pragma
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": ee hee hee, . gives you the whole subject, - gives you
    its head, + gives you its tail
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": s/subject/???/
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": and .< .> -< -> +< +> are all things... except for
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": it can't be the whole subject of everything
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": because THE SUBJECT has to contain... arvo...  doesn't
    it?
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": no, the subject is different depending on what context
    you're in
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: +>
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: er whoops
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": neither .< or .> are valid things
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": yeah because -+<> operate on an implicit subject?
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": dot is like /1?
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: so +> is a core
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": tail of tail?
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": I don't understand why .< is not
                                  - and .> is not +
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: I am going to take a stab in the dark and
    say that it is the arvo core, but I expect to be totally off base
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": +>, that's that horrible ugly thing
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: well i mean when you type it at
                    %batz and get some stuff
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: however, my Hoon has not progressed much
    in a while beyond basic math functions
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": in ., what are the sigs?
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": trying to write a math library made me YEARN for hoon
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: artifact of the print formats for @da and
    @p... and @ta?
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": I think sig is a null when it looks like that
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": all alone on its own line, in .
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": oh right
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": and yes, it's part of the print format
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": so . is... [[date name] ugly]
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": and a mysterious <||>
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": and <||>
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": yes
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": whatever the fark that is
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": I have this sneaking suspicion that if I tell you the
    contents of +
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": you can steal my soul
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" is in the building

    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": still got your soul?
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": well I'm not going to try it then
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": due to lack of chicken, I went and started building
    another pier
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: huh, an assert failure, no less
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": then I tried killing vere and that resurrected me
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: we should be reporting those...
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": an assert failure is what I suffered?  or what you
    suffered?
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": there's no left hand side of <939.wor 83.oco 395.oeo
    84.uwo 9.ixo %939>
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: what I suffered
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": you probably could have recovered with ^C
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": oh hey, right
    ~foptec-nacfed [Colin (Elision) Stanfill] is in the building
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": but then in what sense is it a core
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": I still don't really know what a core is
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: "core" may have not been the best of
    terms
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": I think it's the place where the mutable state is kept
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": but then I slap myself
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne] has left the building
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: alas, we're getting beyond my combination
    of knowledge and guesswork
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": yebyen if you work through the nock docs then you will
    understand what a core is so deeply and truly that it will be a good time
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": I agree, you're probably right
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": don't agree with me, go open them in your browser and
    enable paredit in your text editor
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": :)

    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hopefully not the head...

    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" has left the building
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] has left the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which explains why chickens with their heads
    cut off are so interesting
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": is the output of "." the "subject" that thumb.hoon runs
    "against"?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: they often come up with a brilliant chess move
    or two before their demise
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: no, . for the repl is somewhat different from
    the application subject
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": what is an application's subject?
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm" has been going up to different things and seizing them by
    the lapels and asking them if they are the subject
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this is also ., which always means "the
    subject"
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but what the subject is depends on what you're
    doing
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": does the . in .(stuff) also mean "thes ubject"?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] =>(3 .) 3
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: i9t does
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": ... => means /2?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]:  =>(a b) means "use a as the subject for b"
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": HOORAY
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] really is about to document this
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the problem with the app subject is that it's a
    relatively mature application framework
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": so then =>  .(-< `who=@p`-<) means use -< as the subject
    for that other thing
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and has a whole lot of funky stuff that various
    applications would mean
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": arg
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": I would like SO MUCH to see that subject all diagrammed
    out
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": inasmuch as it were able
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it means, take the subject and replace `-<`,
    ie, nock /4, with nock /4 cast to `who=@p`
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": sweet
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": that's different from `@p` because... I'm sure extant
    hoon doc mentions this
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so the subject you start an application with is
    [[identity application-path] library-stack]
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but we don't give them names, because that
    seems like cheating
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": why?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: suppose you don't speak English?  well, it may
    be too nitpicky
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": oh right
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": well okay, they have essences and fixed locations, that's
    better than a name
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] tries not to bind variable names automagically
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes, they do, -< at that level will never
    change
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": identity is *my* identity?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the program has to know (a) where it is run
    from, (b) who is running it
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this is the basics of configuration, a config
    file can replace this with something more complex
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there is a whole funky configuration loading
    path which hasn't been used at all yet
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but will eventually be needed at the OS level
    for complex apps
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which need, of course, config files
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": you can't just store config in a variable?
    ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm" is in the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: sorry I disappeared
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: your configuration may and will be a single
    noun, ie, - at the top of the file as it were
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this noun may be arbitrarily complex, it may
    contain one label or several
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so, as a way of providing a kind of "default
    configuration," we provide
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": oh, to source parts of it from different places...
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the simple pair of [identity application-path],
    with no labels
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you may want cascading configurations for
    bundles of apps, etc
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": application-path is a filesystem path?
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": what am I saying.  global immutable namespace path!
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes it is.  it's okay to say filesystem... I

    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: as for your escape codes, they cannot go
    directly in a string
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you'd need to assemble them as bytes
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: novchat is waiting for something, not sure what
    ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm" is in the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: [...waiting] should really supply more

    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Any thoughts on why a :reset

    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes - :reset is compiling the whole system from

    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: spewage?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: if it's too long to chat you can send it to
    curtis@tlon.io
    ~roppec-sampyx "Lysergic Spooner": The first line is ! / ~roppec-sampyx/arvo/~2014.1.10..17.22.41..5f8c/hoon/:<[7.216 7].[7.225 9]>
    ~roppec-sampyx "Lysergic Spooner": I'll send you the bulk
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: what's the last line?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the last line is the most significant
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the top of the stack
    ~roppec-sampyx "Lysergic Spooner": Last line before the exit: !  /~roppec-sampyx/arvo/ ~2014.1.10..17.22.41..5f8c/batz/:<[351 15].[351 47]>
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: agh, that's yet another case of "the thread was
    killed but an event was sent to it anyway"
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: some listener was not properly cancelled
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: batz is due for a big rewrite that should
    eliminate all these problems
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but doc takes the priority
    ~roppec-sampyx "Lysergic Spooner": *nods*
    ~roppec-sampyx "Lysergic Spooner": And concurs
    ~roppec-sampyx "Lysergic Spooner": I'll email the output just for the record
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] will have chapter 7 out today, come hell or high
    water
    ~roppec-sampyx "Lysergic Spooner": Perchance a revamped "Security", or did the
    renumbering upset that order
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that too comes after

    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] likes the 'n&' interface, there is no reason at

    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: of course the mechanism of yebyen forking the
    :room server and client is hopelessly hokey
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" is familiar with "the object was killed but an event
    was sent to it anywas" errors. %work has those in spades.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: batz actually has a very solid causal mechanism
    for deregistering listeners when a thread/task goes away
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": Speaking of, I should have some free time on~2014.1.20 to visit Tlon HQ.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but it's not used properly in a couple of ways
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: nandchat got yebyen as neighbor
    but still waiting on room
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] will be around on ~2014.1.20
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: try/7 doesn't seem to work for some reason, try
    try=
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I had the same problem
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": :suggests satnum try a :label.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I would debug this but, you know, it's a doc
    day...
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] seconds the suggestion, after all, THAT'S WHAT
    THEY'RE FOR...
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" remembers them working better than both revision
    numbers and timestamps.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: urbit is nothing but urban.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we'll always be the hood.  besides, rap genius
    does everything hood style and they got 35 million or something
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] plays classical music to make the youfs

    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] 's servers have been running smoothly without

    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] is in the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this is thanks to satfex-difdyr who fixed our
    memory leaks
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: I really need to get hobmed-hinrym going
    again... the theory was that that'd be my true identity, accessible only via
    OpenBSD laptop, but in hindsight that's dumb
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] does think of Steve as hobmed
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we do need a one-face policy in the long run
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: or the medium run
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: when we get over needing lots of spare
    destroyers because things break

    I mean, right now you enforce it by saying, "Hey, could y'all just use one
    destroyer for :chat?  You know, unless you have a good reason."
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that's exactly how :-)
    ~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: Brilliant.
    ~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: Probably won't scale very well as a policy,
    but probably scales better than I would think.
    ~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: suspects he spent too long in a very large

    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": tasfyn: if it's not try/7/bin/chat/hoon, how do I find
    out what it is?
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": or just bind my label to try=/bin/chat/hoon
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": and it will pick the latest copy
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": I have a feeling there is a bug, because it's
    definitely try/7
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes that does seem like a bug
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: try/7 should definitely work
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: does it work from your other destroyer?

    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen" is in the building

    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: probably the configuration request is hitting

    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but you can run try/7/bin/chat from
    novrud-hanweb itself?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]:  = gives you the current time which will always
    pretty much work
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": if an application's subject is [[identity

    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": then what's batz's subject?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: at the kernel level?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: batz itself is a vane
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: batz itself is a vane and starts with simply
    the hoon.hoon kernel stack
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: no state
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: then it pushes its own state on top of it
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": [batz-state kernel-stack]
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you can see it in batz.hoon if you look at
    "section 4bC, shell vane"
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": oh!  that's why . at the prompt gets you something like
    [[identity date] ugly]
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: oh I see what you mean
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: no, that is the subject batz gives to
    expressions on the command line
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": that's what I wanted to ask
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: totally different from the application subject
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that one is created in ++food at line 1084
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is lookin at it now
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] warns the audience that it will probably change
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we throw in: the time as a time, the time as a
    text span, your name as a @p, your name as a text span,
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the results of previous computations,
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": that's <||>?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the variable state (that's why =foo %bar works)
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes, not sure the <||> is operating quite
    correctly
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but basically, the idea is - stuff you need in
    a command
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: all this will probably be changed a little bit
    when we do our combined arvo doc/cleanup pass
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the goal with what's there was to get a stab at
    it
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but you can see why it's different from the
    application subject
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": so the tail of . is the variable state?  the salad in <>
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that's exactly right

    Almost like you did that to break the runes someone came up with, and force
