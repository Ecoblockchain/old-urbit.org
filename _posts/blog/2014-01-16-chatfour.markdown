urbit, `~2014.1.16`:

    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen" is in the building

    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen" has left the building
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] is in the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we have a draft of chapter 8 up, checking it
    for markdown errors
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the doc is speeding up, ladies and gentlemen
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": excitÃ©ment
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: okay, chapter 8 is up
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this one gets us through, basically, how we do
    function calls in hoon
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": it's named chapter 7
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": hep lus glus gras!  I love it
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" is in the building
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" has left the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: pate de hoon gras
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] fixes that...
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has to go and get his kids
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has left the building
    ~padpem-niddut "LeVeutre" has left the building
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": REEF
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": this is so great
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": it never occurred to me that cores would be nested like
    that
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": I thought a library was just a stack of independent
    cores, each of which's context is the whole battery
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": but a reef is way cooler
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: :)
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" is in the building
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": this isn't being parsed right: "when searching in a file,
    /++ arm will always find the definition of arm"
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": by Mr. Hyde I mean
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": it is pretty hard to get things in and around html
    to take whitespace seriously
    ~rovred-pilful "GREYFACE": (except in the cases you want it to ignore
    whitespace)
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: hang on i'll go fix it
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: looks like it's just not grabbing the extra
    space
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: hmmmm, how to fix. how to fix
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" has left the building
    ~hiddem-lomder "atax3a" just got a stream of ~zod is ok!
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" is in the building
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": +>+>+>+>
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": finds the hoon version

    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne] is in the building
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: man one of my co-workers told
    me that tripit is pretty good
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: and he turned out to be right
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: never before have my travel
    plans been so organized
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: this for your sf trip?
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: yep
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] is in the building

    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu" is in the building
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": doxing 101 really is the first thing they teach at
    pontus state -- give it a few years and anonymity will be gone for people who
    don't work very hard at it
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": the arrow keys don't seem to work very well around
    line breaks
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: welcome 
    ~dolrux-nomlup
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: you should check out the banner system
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: switch to your banner with 
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: get help with ?
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: the line breaks are still slightly buggy
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: long lines delete past lines
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and don't press ctrl w
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: it causes problems
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: but other than that
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: this place is pretty solid
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": 
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": so does preceding a line with the prompt send that
    line into the specified place?
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: I keep thinking about the multiline input
    thing
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: (yes it does ~dolrux although the prompt
    character alone will send a blank line)
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: it's just slightly out of reach of most
    stupid fixes I come up with
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: but it is definitely not a hard fix
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: rather, I have like 80% confidence that
    it's not a hard fix
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": multiline input?
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: hard to weight priorities for fixes of
    subsystems that are getting ripped out soon
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: er uh rather when your input line is
    longer than your terminal is wide
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: and it starts eating history lines
    because our term code is lame
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: oh. duh. there's actually a really
    obvious fix.
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: just chop off the start of the input line
    when we redraw.
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": i think that's what irssi does
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: son of a
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: it doesn't even show a character
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: yeah, lemme do that real quick...
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: (the bowels of our term code is the wrong
    place to do this, but it's where I happen to be at the moment, sooooo)

    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen" is in the building
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": I saw there is an explanation of tisgar in ch7 now,
    and I guessed wrong on what it was for
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": also some syntax errors there.  For example "hello, world
    - a is { (scow %ud a) }." fails.
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": but "hello, world - a is {(scow %ud a)}." works
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": so in string 'terpolations, e'n if y'were in Talle Forme,
    ye Spaces be wronge.

    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is in the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: good morning brooklyn!
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: to all the people in the dead sea!
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has left the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is in the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: having some network issues here at sandbox
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but seems okay now
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it's a *core-al* reef, get it
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: funny ha ha
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": hangin' with the -^'s...
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is now and forever hep.
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": yo, daddy-o.  you got that zoot suit ready?
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT" 's father claimed to have once owned a zoot suit.
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": But he could not produce it for inspection so we withheld
    judgement.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] isn't that old but he read about zoot suits in
    "The Autobiography of Malcolm X."
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": well,
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT"  isn't that old EITHER, but his dad was old-ish when he
    was born. (late 40's in 1964 when I first breathed the air of planet erde)
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": so, maybe I am that old. :-(
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] 's internets keep going up and down, this is
    apparently the problem with renting office space
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] feels ancient, generally.
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] is in the building
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": Think of it only as a form of continuous stress testing.
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": The office internets, I mean.
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": Hey, do you have a dog?  Do you need a dog walking
    service? :-)
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT"  has a good friend who runs a dog walking service in SF.
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT"  promises to shut up and stop plugging Arty's Adventures. 
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] does not have a dog.  does your friend walk
    children?
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] has left the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] considers starting a child walking service if
    his startup fails.
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": Hm.  I believe dogs and children are relatively
    equivalent.  Certainly our dogs are easier to walk than our children.
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": I don't think she's huge into children, though.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] never heard of a dog that refused to put its
    pants on in the morning.
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": EXACTLY.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: 
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": Or, agreed to put its pants on and yet inexplicably
    failed to take any directed action in this regard.
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": Dogs and children do have similar feelinga about hygiene,
    though.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: hmm. I should put some pants on.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: (Home offices are not good for discipline,
    it seems.)
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is both in the office and wearing pants.
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": if we wanted discipline, we'd all be writing C++.
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT"  has to return to writing C++ after lunch.. :-(
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: No language with a preprocessor can be
    said to possess discipline, I think
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: "#define private public // lol"
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": OK.  Maybe it's just bondage then.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: it's.... something, definitely
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": OBTW, if I have things I think might be corrections to
    the doc, or possibly bug reports, depending on factors beyond my ken, should I
    submit a pull reque st on the doc tree and let youse guys sort it out?
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT"  swears that if a time machine ever becomes available, he
    will use it to do what is required to divert Stroustrup.
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": Anyway, back to the Real World, non-MTV variant...  lunch
    is over.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: At least some people are taking seriously
    the idea of building something better that covers C++'s use cases.
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT" has left the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you should absolutely submit pull requests to
    the doc
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: speaking of C++, I'm a big fan of Rust
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this project actually started out with the goal
    of building something like Rust
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: yeah. it's pretty funny, graydon was the
    guy who introduced me to haskell
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: rust seems to be a counterexample to the
    thesis that a language or platform has to be bad to be popular
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: (On the other hand, there's Go, which
    suggests that it doesn't have to be bad to be popular, but it helps.)
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: well, rust is not popular yet, but I think it's
    built for the long run
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I want eventually all our jets to be in rust
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] distrusts go due to the GC
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: All the cool kids are excited about Rust,
    which is a favorable sign for future popularity.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: also, you really can't do a typed language
    without genericity
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes it is.  also, Mozilla somehow ended up as
    the only place that both makes money and creates actual new technology.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: well, Mozilla and Google.  If you don't count
    Mozilla as a tentacle of Google.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Yeah. I don't entirely understand it.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ou sont les SGIs d'antan?
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Mozilla is as independent from Google as
    Canada is from the US. Which is to say, they're different places.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: I am not dismayed by any particular
    failing of Go, more so by the enthusiasm with which such a thoroughly mediocre
    tool was received.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: It's pretty much a rehash of the last
    language Rob Pike built so far as I can tell.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: It's amazed me how much weight several
    people I've talked to have placed on the production of single-file executables.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: (Which seems to be a major appeal to Go
    enthusiasts.)
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that's pretty funny about the US and Canada
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I haven't looked at Go all that closely
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I also prefer event systems to thread blocking
    systems, mostly because state between events is much better characterized
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] doesn't like meaningful state to live in stacks
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: well yes, blocking IO is immoral.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: (Purely in a technical sense. ;)
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: well, when you are not doing blocking IO, you
    have to think about congestion in slightly different ways
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: this is true.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has made several early programming mistakes in
    Hoon apps where he built up enormous buffers of unsendable messages
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a blocking system would have prevented this
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Are you familiar with the Hayekian
    argument for event-driven systems?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but on the other hand, the ends do need to know
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the... the what?
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]:
    http://www.erights.org/elib/concurrency/event-loop.html#safety
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] doesn't really see Hayek as a programmer
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes.  well, it might be a metaphor too far
    afield, but basically it's right I think
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the CSP metaphor is just too attractive in some
    ways and becomes very indisciplined
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: at the same time, threading is a way to get
    parallelism, which is rather more difficult in an event system
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] hopes that an urbit which is stable will provide
    many ways for a smart implementation to "cheat" and execute in parallel
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Sure. My usual argument on that is that
    threading is only a useful application-level concept for a small set of use
    cases
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: where you have cpu-bound tasks that can be
    parallelized, but don't want to spread them over multiple hosts
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes.  also, the better your system is at FP,
    the easier it is to make things that look like threads within the event model.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: games and web browsers are the typical
    examples... and Rust tasks seem to cover that pretty well
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: sure.  but this is generally small-scale
    parallelism by definition
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: right.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: much of it is covered by something like a
    parallelizable loop
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it's pretty easy to automagically parallelize
    various kinds of list comprehensions
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: For large scale parallelism, an event loop
    model works OK because you can run one event loop per process
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: because hey, you couldn't share that data
    any faster than by message passing anyway, right
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but there are certainly cases where you'd like
    to take the Arvo event loop and squeeze out some parallelism
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Right. and some of the recent work on STM
    helps there
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: right as well.  ultimately this will happen
    when Arvo is extremely stable and none of it is in practice interpreted
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: if you have deterministic steps in your
    execution model, you can run a bunch of them simultaneously and roll back the
    ones that conflict
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that's exactly right, especially with an
    immutable data model
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: well that does make the implementation
    simpler, to be sure. :)
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: actually apart from the vanes (kernel modules),
    the arvo event loop at the end of hoon.hoon is only about 300 lines
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: relatively simple dispatch semantics, although
    it's a little more complicated than you might expect
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the basic principle is that an event comes with
    a stack of paths (a duct), so it is very easy to build a service-response
    pattern
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]  nods
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and this little kernel thingy has been quite
    stable
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: in fact we seem to be more or less at infinite
    uptime with zod and doznec
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we are probably going to do another continuity
    breach at some point, but if we had to not do it we could
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it would be hard to imagine creating "state
    that lasts for ever" if part of that state was encoded as blocked threads
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: when you don't let the programmer block, you
    force her to actually decide what her state is
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: this is true
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: then, she can write a function to update it and
    so on when she upgrades her app
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: actually to implement what appears to be
    blocking on network resources
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: to the programmer this looks like blocking on
    the global namespace
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but it's not blocking
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: state and upgrade are issues rather poorly
    addressed by most systems
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: actually what happens is that we just throw
    away the computation and requeue the event (not at the arvo level, at the batz
    level)
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: right. this is pretty much the same
    conclusion E reached
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is trying to build a personal cloud computer, so
    it should just upgrade itself without even thinking about it
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] thinks E's major problem was always its biggest
    feature, the capabilities
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: if you solve identity you don't need
    capabilities
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the question I as a server should be asking is
    not: what rights does this peer have?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the right question is: who is this peer?  and
    then, what rights have I granted to that identity?
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: "need" is always a slippery concept when
    discussing fundamental abstractions. if you have nock you don't need hoon. :)
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: That's a good question but it ignores
    agency. Sometimes I want others to do things on my behalf.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: of course one doesn't need anything, it's an
    aesthetic question of right and wrong
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: perhaps there are corner cases of complex
    delegation, but it is a mistake I feel to build them in at the bottom layer
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: complex cases should be handled in complex ways
    at a higher level
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is certainly possible to think about
    capabilities on top of an identity layer
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but they exist in unusual, not usual, cases
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you are not putting as much weight on the
    feature.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: hmm. I seem to recall something being said
    about things having to start from a simple model if they're ever going to
    work... :)
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: :)
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the thing is, identity is a simple problem if
    you just grab the bull by the horns
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: abstracting identity is not a simple problem
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Anyway. The higher-level implications of
    capabilities are more debatable and less immediately interesting to me than the
    practical implica tions of having a secure, principled object model
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] prefers namespaces to objects
    ~rovrel-bicmyl has left the building
    ~rovrel-bicmyl is in the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: if you force human-readable paths at all
    levels...
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: I guess this comes down to trees vs graphs
    then. :)
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it does.  and I don't like to build graphs of
    opaque pointers even on a single system
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has to go water the horses.

    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] likes to have interesting technical discussions
    on :chat
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": The vere pauses appear to be: fsync takes 0.2 seconds
    approximately, and then another 0.2 seconds of mprotect/SIGSEGV, and then
    read(0) reads 10 bytes.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" hasn't sat down with a stopwatch to judge how long it
    pauses, just notes that it's noticeable.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": When it is performing well, read(0) always gets 1 byte
    at a time.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that is really really slowness
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] attributes it to your unusual configurationz
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" is willing to accept that as a diagnosis.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it's still not optimal
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: basically, vere is a prototype 
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it actually works pretty well for a prototype
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": That it does.
    ~fosryg-sonbet "kulibali" is in the building
    ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm": you are saying "prototype" as if "prototype" is even a
    thing
    ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm": it's not because a voluntary rewrite is usually a
    disaster
    ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm": (and involuntary ones result from disasters)
    ~fosryg-sonbet "kulibali" has left the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: well, there's rewriting and rewriting
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: my feeling is that the time to rewrite is when
    you don't have to
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: in a tall system software stack, preserving the
    lack of a need to rewrite is crucial
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: vere itself is a relatively thin layer, and
    relatively clean in some ways
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but it should not be too hard to replace its
    noun/nock layer with a 64-bit one that has an LLVM JIT
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and this is in fact what we're doing (or it's
    what Chris Cole is doing)
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Steve is also making the event log Raft-powered
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but in general, it should end up as a very
    clean, durable, stable system
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so that we can spend our energy on userspace...

    interestingly
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: :chat definitely remains a prototype
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it's correlated with a went-fear message that
    indicates a message was received, but the process waiting for it was dead
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: :room needs to receive a negative ack for this
    and consider the message as failed

    containing dynamic data) - but it's better than a tumor...
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: no, that's too grisly.  we'll make it "book"
    and "cart."

    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: sends but won't receive?
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: so eventually i quit vere
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: restarted it, and it
    connected fine
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: but then when i did :chat, it
    didn't go through any backlog
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: also i saw some messages
    starting with %went-fear
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: yes, i believe tasfyn-partyv was just
    noticing this deficiency in chat's implementation
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i wouldn't have seen

    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: right, for a state-speech
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: by a statesman
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": the mental state that leads to stating that the

    ~racbes-solmun "kpm" checks in to see what state the state is in

    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": It depends on the banner. I doubt %zen would be

    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: spoken like a man who has not spent

    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: do we actually have a %zen banner

    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: no we don't that I know of

    ~hiddem-lomder "atax3a": we can read ypu
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": oh good, it's working
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: you are likely scrolling through the backlog
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": my laptop is a bit slow, that's all
    ~hiddem-lomder "atax3a": and you.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": nah, I'm used to backlog from IRC and such, figured
    it was backlog. takes a bit before my text even gets properly entered...
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": is there a way to move what computer your urbit
    stuff is on?
    ~hiddem-lomder "atax3a": move the pier, it is portable
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": And ~/.urbit
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: pier, urb/$ships and ~/.urbit
    ~hiddem-lomder "atax3a": but don't run the same pier from more than one
    ~hiddem-lomder "atax3a": oh, yes, the passcode
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": alright, that's good to know
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Duplicating ships on the network would be like crossing
    the streams, so it's rumored.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": the urbit tutorials read like some alien...thing,
    like all the words are the same, but mean something else entirely. felt like
    learning how to use c omputers for the first time, heh. so I decided "hey, why
    not try this thing out?"
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": after all, the worst that can happen is I have to
    reinstall xubuntu
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Have you ever read Stephenson's Anathem, ~tognex?
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": nope
    ~hiddem-lomder "atax3a" has left the building
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": If you like the "urbit sensation" of familiar words
    signifying strange things, Anathem inspires the dual emotion of strange words
    mapped to familiar things.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": so does this chat let you chat with all urbit chat
    users currently using urbit chat?
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Correct.
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: some are paying more attention than

    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": bet that'll get cramped if urbit takes off.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": am I accidentally sending things
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: don't think so?>
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: hopefully by the time it
    would get cramped
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": ok, good. just checking, what do these "..."s mean?
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: there'll be a better chat
    system
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": hah! hopefully something similar to IRC.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": multiple channels and all that
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": ... means your ship is waiting for a response from
    ~doznec, the :room server.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: I did expect vere to print "I am a
    prototype for a much larger system." when I started it.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": ah, okay.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": so does urbit have any practical uses yet?
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": friendship
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: conversation
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: ideas
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik" shrugs
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": works for me.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Conspiracy (behind banners).
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": heh, how do banners work?
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": There are three prefixes
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": "
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": "&"
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": and ~$shipname
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": which switch the recipient of the messages which follow
    them
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": "
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: but the switch to and from
    banner at one point worked differently from the swtich to and from direct
    message
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: it may still
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": %blue, in your case, ~tognex.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Isn't "confusing people" enough of a
    purpose? :)
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": heh
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Confusion and enlightenment dance in such close order.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: 
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": yeah, I chose blue because, well, it seemed a
    reasonably safe choice, while not being as boring as white
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: i think i figured out why programmers like
    Zen stories/koans so much.
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: am i the only %white?
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: i take great pride in being boring
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": quite possibly
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": so how do you use the prefixes?
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: It's because they're usually about a
    smarter person saying stuff to confuse dumber people, and then hitting them.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": E.g. 
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": 
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Only %blue comrades would see this, and your prompt
    would change from & to 
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": alright, so just start a message with the prefix,
    and future messages will be sent to that one?
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: 
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Correct, until you send a message with a different
    prefix.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": ok!
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i am still confused by
    prefixes
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": There is no null message, so & or 
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": How so, ~labfes?
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": (Also, type ? for the help page.)
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: now i am less confused
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: am i the only one?
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: maybe the only one on right this minute.
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: 
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: ah, so you don't just prefix the
    message
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": talsur, I have :thumbed nearly every ship to sail these
    waters, and have seen a multiplicity of every banner.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": i suppose i'm all alone in blueland?
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": currently, anyway
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: *whew
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": \?
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: was there a precursor to :thumb?
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": whew?
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: i remember using something else
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": :report
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: talsur what do you mean by
    "don't just prefix the message"
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": tognex kind of sounds like the name of some alien
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Which still works, but give the entire routing path.
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: like, send a 
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: don't just prefix a message with 
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Ah, but not too alien, for it still sounds like a name.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": better than fantyv.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": talsur, but you do send a message - a blank message.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Or rather, empty but not null.
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: so there's always an empty message
    for a switch
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Is this the real life, or is this just fan-ty-v?
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: but not after that
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": so, how many people typically come on?
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": because this is rather interesting.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": talsur, yes, but the initial switch can also send a
    message.
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: fantyv, you mean will
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": I will now send: 
    ~talsur-todres Ave.
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: right?
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: right, like 
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": so fantyv, why aren't we calling you jpt4? :P
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm" has left the building
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4":  
    ~talsur-todres Ave.
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: 
    ~fantyv-ralpen
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Because I am 
    ~fantyv-ralpen.
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: right, but the first message is
    sent publicly?
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": so we all go by ship names, not our... usernamey
    things?
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": No, I accidentally added an ace at the beginning.
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: i think i did too, so no switch
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: I am not sure a strong convention has
    emerged. :)
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: 
    ~fantyv-ralpen
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": We are still both public, ~talsur-san.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": dondep, ?
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: confused, for the moment
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I tend to check in and out at any
    and all times of day
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: do we have to say :hi first?
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: ~
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: yes
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": so what kind of things do you lot talk about
    ~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc] is in the building
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": What do you like to talk about, Tiktalik?
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": ello, nosryl
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": eh, lots of things
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": depends on what things i feel like talking about.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Ichthyology, perhaps?
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": heh, this username was mostly chosen on a whim, and
    it's hard for the people who are bad at using google to find out about stuff
    i've done
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": sure, it can be thwarted with a bit of skill, but
    most people have no clue how
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: you could also just tell us
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": well, every once in a while I /attempt/ to program,
    with varying levels of success
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": i play various online games like minecraft, or tf2,
    or etc
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": kind of a boring person.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": I am prepared to declare at least 3/4 of the Urbit
    population "Axios", if you are worried.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": Axios?
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": sounds ominous, even if I have no clue what it means
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": "Worthy" or "He is worthy" in Greek.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": What we call meritocracy ought properly be named
    axiocracy.
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: well, at this stage, if you're even
    here
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": ah
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: that's a pretty good sign
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: merit is just using the command
    line
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": so what can I do with my battleship, besides chat?
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: destroyer!
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Your destroyer is your own personal Hoon machine.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": oh right, destroyer
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: you can do anything you want with
    it
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: .0
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: what
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: man a game of battleship
    would be cool
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Work through the doc (along with everyone else) and join
    the world of personal, general purpose, functional computing.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": so what are the various arvo files destroyers/subs
    grab?
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Applications.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Like synchronizing with a package manager that only has
    one repository.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": i see. so basically, what applications you get is up
    to the whims of the network?
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": No, it is up to the whim of ~zod.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": For your submarine.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": And ~doznec, for your destroyer.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": I see.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": So destroyers, do they get more stuff than
    submarines?
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: so whichever ship our ship
    comes from determines our software
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": oh, ok
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i was asking
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": labfes, yes, although that's not as important as
    receivng namespace.
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: what is recving namespace
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Your destroyer is one of 2^32.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": 2^16 of which were begotten of ~doznec.
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: begotten ... not made
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Tiktalik: I am one of the few
    non-coders in the Urbitverse at present
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: badump
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": what happens if they run out of destroyers?
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Of one being with ~zod, father of ~doznec.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": We run out.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": well difryt, glad to see there are others here who
    don't code.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": though I've been working on it.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Each destroyer can spawn 2^32 yachts.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: imrowan, i am sure cgy would just say that
    means you have less to unlearn before using hoon
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: ;-)
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Precisely why I'm hoping for one
    of those Hoon Like I'm 5 *g*
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": (I believe that is the number.)
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": But each yacht is dependent on its destroyer.
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: OT does anyone know if beer
    is good at dealing with hot spicy taste
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Only destroyers and above have independent, alloidial,
    reputation.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: definitely not, needs something
    emulsifying like milk
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": labfes, lipids are what you want.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": so... anything below destroyers is temporary?
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Not temporary, dependent.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": submarines?
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": If anything, submarines are temporary, since there are
    so many of them.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: submarines are, I think, independent.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Yes, they are independent, even of ~zod, I believe.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": well, what happens when all the destroyers are gone?
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i am lactose intolerant so i
    guess i will just tough it out
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: tognex people will sell them
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Destroyers won't be gone, just owned
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: they are like real estate
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": labfes, drink olive oil.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: and you can get one from someone who has
    one
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": and yeah labfes, olive oil works
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: right now, the destroyer
    market is like this video: http://youtu.be/cd4-UnU8lWY
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] will shortly be making the switch to 
    ~hobmed-hinrym
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": It's like the Metaverse in Snow Crash
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": so destroyers are free and plentiful, but later on
    there'll be less of them avaliable, and they'll start being something that
    needs paid for?
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": proximity, ergo space, matters to humans.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": So Urbit simulates space via address scarcity.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: yes. this is because right now destroyers
    are worthless, being only useful for super nerds who want to use a chat system
    worse than IRC
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: that video is so perfect
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": heh. what about yachts?
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] has left the building
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": how do they work
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: yachts essentially belong to their
    destroyer, as I understand it.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": You issue them with the :ticket command.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Which produces a ticket for the yacht name (address)
    given.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": what do higher-tier ships provide, anyway?
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Routing.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": And default software.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": What does a particular distribution of GNU/Linux
    provide?
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] is in the building
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: I really want to hear more about what
    access patterns this identity system is going to provide.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Support, and some mix of utilities beyond the kernel
    itself.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: if ships are like land, what's the
    equivalent of a lease?
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: scratch that. turns out I activated
    hobmed on another computer this era...
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Lease, ~dondep? 
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Would you not prefer to own instead of rent?
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: kind of a silly question
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: people prefer to own and rent in different
    situations re land
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: sometimes you want one, or the other
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": do any of you think urbit has a serious chance of
    taking off, out of curiosity?
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": I can lease your cyber-space by executing code on your
    machine.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: I own a few computers. It's convenient to
    lease one from Amazon for a few hours.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": i have doubts, but if it does, it's worth the effort
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": That's what the access control metals provide.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Currently we are all %gold.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Its like templeOS or the Commodore64, all ring 0.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": But unless virgin, land is always owned.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": *virgin and feral
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": I don't mean that to be rude, I'm just curious as to
    if you people think it'll honestly take off
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": I would prefer that it did.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": I think it will not die for as long as I am alive.
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Failing world domination or even
    mainstream recognition, I'd be satisfied with Urbit providing a useful
    alternative to the existi ng Internet.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": And it will expand for as long as Czyarvin is alive.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: I think it's too soon to tell
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: but if Urbit doesn't survive, it'll be
    because something based on similar principles superseded it
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": What /is/ urbit, anyway
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": I've been trying to figure that out
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": os? internet alternative?
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Its a very tightly integrated system
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: the whole software stack here
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": ok, so all of the above?
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: yes, it's a distributed OS
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: i think that's apt dondep â that if
    it doesn't survive it's because something similar overtakes it
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: which means it provides both a basis for
    computation and a communications system designed to work with it
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: The Web is also a distributed OS
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": so are there any urbit...sites?
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: there's a web server
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: somewhere
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: it's just one that accreted more-or-less
    by accident rather than a thing designed to be one.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": (*It's, incidentally. Curse my apostrophe neglect.)
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": (This record is public and eternal darn it, edit what
    you type ~fantyv.)
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: apostrophic
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Just for PR's sake, once you have
    a "What Is Urbit" for public consumption, it'd be worth adding to the Archive
    Team's page at ht tp://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/Hoon
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": so where are the conspiracies
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: I think our gracious host is probably
    wrong about how far the concept of identity takes you, so I'm not putting all
    my technical eggs in t he Urbit basket -- the capability model of authority
    management has major benefits, from my perspective, over traditional ACLs
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": You're in one right now, ~tognex.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": any deeper layers?
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": probably hidden under the non-blue banners
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Behind banners, mostly.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": i mean, do blues even have anything to conspire over
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Start your own. Conspiracies are cool, and very
    underrated.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: 
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Speaking of distributed OSes, here's an
    essay I really enjoyed:
    http://dreamsongs.com/Files/DesignBeyondHumanAbilitiesSimp.pdf
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": i'm not even sure if i've picked the banner i want,
    heh
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": is there a way to change it, if you have a political
    change of heart?
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Not until the re-keying protocol is finished.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": ok.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": You essentially will have to re-:begin your ship
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": also, this chat is publically logged? D:
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": which will also happen after the next continuity breach.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Yes, ~doznec stores everything it sees, your ship stores
    everything it sees, mine does...
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": ah, so either way, we'll be beginning again
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": now that's just spooky
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": i expected less surveilance and data collection
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": not more of it
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": how much HD space does that eat, anyway
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Run du -h on your pier to find out.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": That's where the event log and checkpoint are stored.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Also, this is more like sousveillance than surveillance
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": sousvevillance?
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": everyone knows everyone, by default, records all
    interactions in which they take part.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": oh, like what I do in every irc channel I'm in. :P
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": ah. is there a way to have private interactions?
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: yes, you start a message with ~shipname
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: 
    ~tognex-labmeb
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": The :hi ~$shipname "message" approach also works, from
    the command line.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": ah.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Those kinds of communication are encrypted by default.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": and will that be tracked by both of them?
    ~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: 
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: no one
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: except both end points
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": well, that's good to know... probably safer than
    IRC, actually
    ~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]  just read the help.  It's quite helpful.
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: you get the help by typing ?
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": yeah, found it
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": so is there a way to remove history and such from
    your ship?
    ~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: 
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": As I understand, yes in theory, but it would be a
    particularly Orwellian operation.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": The false history would have to be crafted so as to keep
    present state identical.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": what happens if stuff just gets from the ship
    folder? things go boom?
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": And any computation that relied on the past, now
    disappeared, events would fail.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Do you mean urb/$shipname?
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": yes
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": It depends on what you remove.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": I just don't feel entirely secure with a conspiracy
    that can be thwarted via the lead pipe manuver, you know?
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: can stuff actually be deleted
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": http://xkcd.com/538/
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: can ship space ever be freed
    up
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": In the arvo filesystem, yes.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: these sound like good questions to raise
    in... 50 minutes
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": The event log records inputs, not outputs.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": If you've ever had the "replaying events" message when
    starting your pier
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": your ship was re-computing the results of its past
    history
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": to bring you to its present state.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": oh. so it was doing everything it did in the past,
    all over again?
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: is there a system that's resistant
    to lead pipe cryptanalysis?
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": From the last checkpoint, yes.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": If I encrypt something with 99999999999999999999 bit RSA
    and die, then yes.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": talsur, store the password in muscle memory and get
    them to break all your fingers
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: the dying part is "key"
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": But deletion is isomorphic to rendering unreadable.
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: sorry, meant 'practical' system
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": woah, hey. let's not die
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Dying is very practical.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": not really
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": you have to stop EVERYTHING you're doing
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": just so that you can stop existing?
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": It simply demands a very stringent cost-benefit
    analysis.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": >:
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: deleting files from urb/$ship does nothing
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: other than change the latest version of that
    file
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: past versions are unaffected
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": k
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Are they copied entirely, or is only a delta stored with
    each change?
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": So that the latest version is in fact the sum of the
    initial version and all recorded changes?
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: btw if you do a git pull && make clean
    all, you'll get a vere that doesn't destroy terminal history on long lines
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: the way it doesn't destroy terminal
    history is a little cheesy, unfortunately
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: namely we just chomp off a prefix of your
    line, which in chat can be a little disorienting, I'm just now discovering
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: a more real fix is coming real soon now
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: in the meantime, hopefully you're less
    confused about missing the first parts of your own messages than you were about
    missing entire chu nks of other people's messages
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": 
    ~fantyv-ralpen
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Does it require restarting vere to take effect?
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: yeah, it's a C level hack
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Thank you.
    ~ladhut-docfyn [Dan Haffey] is in the building
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] frequently finds himself working at C
    level
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] rarely ventures far below C level
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm" is in the building
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": i wonder if urbit will ever be able to run on
    raspberri pis
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: I thought we had some people doing
    that...
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Yebyeb, I believe.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": *yebyen
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": yebyeb is an Ewok greeting.
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm" has left the building
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": could also be an urbit user
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: we had someone run urbit on a pi like a month or
    two ago
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": oh, ok
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": could you get a native version going, that ran
    directly on the pi?
    ~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: Um, you could ssh from the pi to an Amazon EC2
    instance and run it there.
    ~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: That's totally not what you're trying to do,
    though.
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: okay, git pull again. the bug is actually
    really fixed now.
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: (&& make, of course)
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: and magically, vere feels like a solid
    piece of software.
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: I am looking at terminal history as
    actually useful information, rather than just a string of lies.
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": my little vere: urbit is magic
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu"  self-immolates
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: that was quick
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": No, that's ~satfex's schtick.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": The self-immolation part.
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: :-
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": is potato a possible urbit ship name bit?
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu"  imagines a glorious cyberpunk future where all the
    cool kids are urbed in to their ships via raspberry-colored glasses
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] nearly got immolated once
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Bad Zen monk joke.
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": no, they're all consonant-vowel-consonant
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] has left the building
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: in the back of a truck in Mexico...
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": how are these things supposed to be pronounced
    anyway
    ~balweb-sarlyt [Mark Zavislak] is in the building
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Did any Tibetan politics percolate through your Zen
    training, ~satfex?
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": is it just as in lojban? or IPA? or pseudo-english?
    (though that'd be confusing and merge a lot of things)
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: I don't think official standards have been
    promulgated
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: the driver had stopped at a gas station.
    someone in the back -- there were like eight of us, with one guy hanging on the
    top -- decided t o fill up a gatorade bottle with gas. the bottle, sitting next
    to me, had its lid fall off at some point. I was pretty freaked for... a while.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]  scrolls a bit
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: minimal, jpt4
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: they're supposed to be pseudo-english
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: tom-sight ball-sen
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: also it wasn't Zen training, it was
    Modern Mindfulness training with a strong Zen flavor
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": yeah but then you get ambiguity
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: I would say tom seet ball sen
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": i think
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: tom-sit
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: is actually what i thought
    first
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": fan tive rahl pen
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": i'm imagining a crazy urbit-using future
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": in which everyone laughs at past computes in museums
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: computes
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Thank you for the clarification, ~satfex.
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: computilators
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: I'd settle for a future where people even
    looked at computers in museums.
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i'd settle for a future
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: we do have a computer history museum
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": "oh man, they used the internet. the internet! what
    were they thinking? how did that even hold itself together?"
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: "those nerds!"
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: you mean the one in Mt View? It's pretty
    nice.
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": psh, this desk is a computer history museum
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: My wife didn't understand much of it, but
    she understood I was /very/ excited.
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen" is in the building
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": ello novrud
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": my old mac got eaten by rats but i still have an ibm
    clone running win3.1, thing's older than i am
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: devoured by rats, eh?
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": Hello tognex
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: but yeah. The general vein of thought
    Urbit taps is "Picture the Internet, including the Web. Now imagine someone
    built a system like that on purpose, instead of it just happening over a few
    decades while people were pursung other goals."
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm" is in the building
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": well dondep, maybe it'll even get built well. :P
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: I have some aesthetic disagreements about
    urbit's design choices. But I like its way of doing it better than everyone
    else's way of not do ing it.
    ~rigryx-sovrus "atax2a" has a few old Macs and an old NeXT slab.
    ~lidfeb-tabpub "graycoder" is in the building
    ~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc] has left the building
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": yep, when things get done, it's not because they're
    the best possible things, but because they were done by whoever decided to do
    the things
    ~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc] is in the building
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: those who hold passionate views about the
    layout of the building are advised to start swinging hammers when the hammers
    start swinging
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": but dondep, will urbit do its goal /well/?
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: I hope so!
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: but prediction is hard, especially about
    the future.
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": i come today from an android tablet that is sshed into
    another android tablet
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: voltron style
    ~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: Let nobody say that novrud doesn't know how to
    party.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": tognex, with sufficient uncertainty about the future
    performance of the present system, different is already better.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": true
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": perhaps urbit will start a revolution
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": perhaps it won't
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": novrud, were you the one to run Urbit from a Raspberry
    Pi?
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]:  Even if the existing Urbitverse
    doesn't gain traction, perhaps a fork of it might (though less likely IMO; more
    likely someone t akes Hoon/Nock and builds an OS better than Arvo, not just
    forking existing Arvo and generating their own keys.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": ok, so arvo is the os, hoon is the programming
    language, and nock is..?
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: The virtual machine
    ~rovsyp-hatbep [Aaron Beckerman] is in the building
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": As well as the model of computation, like the lambda
    calculus for LISP machines, or register machines for C.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ladies and gentlemen
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": so you could make a nock processor? :P
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": fantyv - no, I believe I was the first to run urbit on
    an arm machine though, unless someone else managed to run it...
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": without tripping over the bug 
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Yes!
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: :room is a little bit slow I sense
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": greetings, rovsyp
    ~lidfeb-tabpub "graycoder" has left the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: performance is not our specialty at the moment
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but that's okay!
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: anyway
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": ...i can tell
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I had suggested such a thing
    partly in jest, for the most part a hardware implementation of Nock would
    apparently be more trouble than it's worth (according to the experts)
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": i mean, i can't even see the stuff i'm entering in
    real time
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: what are you on, tognex?  must be fairly slow
    to not keep up with keystrokes
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: in any case
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the time is ~2014.1.15..03.00.26..2258
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: I suspect that once we get everything on
    Nock, Nock will start to look chunky and stupid
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which means
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it's time for our chat
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Only because it's not echoing
    back to you by default - when I type something on this destroyer, it shows up
    on my other one prett y instantly
                                                                                                                                                                                     
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] would be really happy to live in a world
    where Nock looked chunky and stupid
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] likes to say, silence from the peanut gallery
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but we're all peanuts really
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but in any case
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: p.nuts
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I have some some announcements
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: first of all, in case you haven't seen them,
    chapters 7 and 8 of the Urbit doc are now available
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: covering some pretty basic basics of how Hoon
    works
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: chapters 9 and 10 will complete most of the
    core Hoon doc
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and should be released this week
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: second, in case you or anyone you know is in SF
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": tasfyn, you one of the main urbit devs?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yup I pretty much built this thing...
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4" salutes the Grand Admiral Yarvin.
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i dunno tasfyn, who are you again?
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT" is in the building
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: what are you doing here?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we are having a meetup next Monday
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: where de burger at?
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: "You might very well think that;
    I couldn't possibly comment."
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen" has left the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: 7pm PST at Zeitgeist, a notorious biker bar
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: if any fans of other languages / platforms show
    up, there may be a rumble
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: tognex, curtis has been building urbit since 202
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is aging but still pretty effective with a bike
    chain
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: errr, 2002
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is not that old!
    ~wacrel-ripwes "Salo" is in the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: also, I spent 6 years on Nock, which is a page
    of code and gzips to 350 bytes
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: but is still handy with a bike chain
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but admittedly there was a lot of surfing
    during these years
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: in any case...
    ~minbec-wansyl [Michael (mhartl) Hartl] is in the building
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: boards or browsers?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: boards.  not very well, either.  also some
    browsers :-)
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Monday the 20th, Zeitgeist in SF, 7pm
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that's ~2014.1.21..03.00.00 Urbit time
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: just so you know
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: it's gonna be fun, we'll laugh, we'll drink,
    we'll pick a fight with the googlers
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: all four of the Tlon (the corporate tentacle of
    Urbit) guys will be there
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so that's cool
    ~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett] is in the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: other cool stuff... we have successfully
    auctioned off ~nyt, Fare's _per fortuna_ carrier
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it went for 15.5 bitcoins
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which means the value of the entire Urbit
    address space is 
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" is in the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] (sub (mul 16 256) 128) 3.968
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: bitcoins
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which is according to our latest calculation
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: almost half the market cap of Dogecoin
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so it's a start anyway.  also in other news
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: actually, there is good news and bad news
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the first piece of good news is that, as
    promised (and as we warned our, you know, actual investors)
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Tlon has donated 32 carriers to urbit.org, so
    have I
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which gives us 64 for the vague goal of
    promoting community spirit, etc, etc
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and the second piece of good news is that we
    are distributing carriers to our faithful supporters
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the bad news unfortunately
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: is that if you're receiving a carrier, you have
    already been told so
    ~wacrel-ripwes "Salo" has left the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it being unfortunately necessary to draw a very
    arbitrary line
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but let me go back to the beginning and explain
    the process here
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the basic idea of urbit from an
    economic/political standpoint
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: is that if we achieve world domination the
    present price of a carrier
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: $12K or so by a very unscientific sample of 1
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: will go up by 3 to 4 orders of magnitude
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: on the other hand
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we are a long way from world domination
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we are a skeezy little prototype in some dark
    alley of the internets
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there is a very long journey from prototype to
    colossus
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: therefore an essential ingredient of the design
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: is to use the limited address space and its
    potential value
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: to motivate development and developers
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: at least it motivated me to develop this crazy
    thing
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so perhaps it can motivate others
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: if they're as crazy as me at least
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but this is surprisingly more difficult than it
    seems
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: because you don't want to basically just use
    this resource as money to pay people
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: money makes everything unfun
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this is open source
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it should be crazy and wild and cool and fun
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is crazy and wild and cool and fun
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": there should be a bit of wild-west to it
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: as there was to the original internets, of
    course
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we are a tiny desperate insane underdog punk
    cult
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: furthermore
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: an urbit carrier isn't just a prize
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is not like bitcoin in that it's just
    something you own
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is also a duty and a trust
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: while the present governance mode of urbit is,
    like most open source projects
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": it's a seat in the imperial senate
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a ruthless absolute dictatorship
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": we can fiddle while the emperor burns
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we want it to scale
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: to scale it must become a republic, with
    multipolar governance/
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": curtis, why are you saying all the things
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": so many lines ;_;
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: u have to be able to read as fast as I can type
    :-)
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": oh please, I can type seriously fast, and read
    faster than I type
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": what's the point of having dictators without
    dictatorial speeches
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is not designed to require central authority
    in any formal sense
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": but I come back a few inutes later and my entire
    term window is full of your stuff
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": as it should be.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I forgot to mention
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that after I rant like a dictator for a number
    of minutes
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: all we will have left is Q&A
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan] is using 191x55 terminal at 16pt
    font with 1920x1080 res on 27" monitor
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but there is a little more ranting to go
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: with a generous tmus buffer
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: *x
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is also a fan of teh giant screens
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: in any case, hatteb is right
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the carriers are essentially a senate
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: in the good old Roman sense
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: an effective constitution is always one in
    which formal and informal power are aligned
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the Roman Senate ceased to matter when the
    Senators ceased to matter
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: according to the cryptographic structure of
    urbit, however
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the carriers will always have a critical role
    in collective governance
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so we want them to be mostly good people
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a few bad eggs, or even lost keys, the system
    can bear
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but we don't want it to turn into a
    bureaucratic-corporate suitzone full of corrupt liars, like ICANN
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ideally all carriers will be held by distinct
    individuals, whose personal responsibility is significant
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: corporate ownership is inevitable at this
    stage, but in the long run frowned upon
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we are very into individuals
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" specifies Dual_EC-DRBG as the official urbit drbg.
    Here, have these constants.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and if there is one word we would like to apply
    to those individuals
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: (we currently roll our own with SHA256, which
    is crude, but on the other hand, no mysterious government constants!)
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": well then
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that word is: virtuous
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": you should give me all your carriers ;D
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a government of virtuous individuals cannot
    help but be virtuous
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: (you will have a chance to earn at least one!)
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so in my dictatorial majesty I deliberated,
    silently, on my mountaintop
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and then I decided, speaking from the balcony
    like Mussolini,
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that the process would work like this:
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the qualifications for receiving a carrier from
    urbit.org are: a demonstrated virtue.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the carriers will be distributed in rounds,
    each round beginning when the last ends.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: in general, we favor early adopters, so the
    sooner you join us the better you'll do.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": heh, well, I'm 15. doubt I'm suited for carrier
    ownership
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: (it is notable that out of the three round 1
    winners who sold their carriers,
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: (that's excellent - we are still waiting for
    our first urbiter born in the 21st century)
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: (but painfully close!)
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" is 27 and isn't suited for carrier ownership!
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] went to college when he was 15, actually, so he
    is very favorable toward young people who don't know their place
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: out of the three who sold, anyway, the longer
    they waited, the more money they got - hint hint
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but in any case, each round promotes a virtue
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": oh cool i'm not the only one. src, or?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: src, or?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: each round promotes a virtue
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the virtue to be promoted is announced *after*
    the round, so you can't guess
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: they are all classical or pseudo-classical
    virtues
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: in the first round, carriers were issued to
    people who submitted a Nock decrement in 2010
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: in 2010 I posted Nock on the internets and said
    that anyone who wrote a decrement would receive a prize
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the prize turned out to be worth, as of present
    writing, 15.5 bitcoins
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": guess not. src = college exclusively for people who
    start college early
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: oh Simon's Rock, I know of it
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: no, I started at Hopkins and transferred to
    Brown
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: in any case
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: these people demonstrated a very important
    virtue
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the virtue of Fortune, aka, luck
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and their carriers are marked "per fortuna"
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] only goes to sea surrounded by lucky people
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but that was then and this is now
    ~minbec-wansyl [Michael (mhartl) Hartl]: velut luna, statu variabilis
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and the virtue we are rewarding today
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: is another important classical virtue much
    neglected in our age
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Loyalty - or, in Latin, fidelis
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: basically the people who received carriers
    today re were, of course, political disagreements at the root of it..
                                                                                                                                                                                     
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: are the people who have been showing up,
    dealing with bugs, chatting, programming, learning, etc, etc
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: for the past 3 months while everything has gone
    from totally broken to, well, a working chat server
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and we have really nothing else to reward
    ~wacrel-ripwes "Salo" is in the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: because it hasn't really been possible to make
    the community contribute useful changews
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: because our language doc is still not quite
    done, etc, etc
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there have been some useful changes, amazingly,
    but not much
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I cannot disclose of course the virtue that
    will be rewarded in the next round have.
                                                                                                                                                                                     
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but it will certainly involve doing Useful
    Stuff
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: in some sense of the word
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: 
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is also important to note
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that one of the rules of the Festival of
    Virtues
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: for so we call it
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": i qualify as a young person who doesnt know their
    place in life :p
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: is that anyone who already owns a carrier is
    ineligible for the actual prize, though they still receive the honor
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": anyway, keep on talking about your carrier plans
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: young man, you have already taken the right
    first step!
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but in any case...
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I should actually list the winners
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is more decorous to do so by their destroyer
    names:
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen" is in the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]:   
    ~difryt-dapdeg 
    ~boswed-nibnyd 
    ~racbes-solmun 
    ~lontec-botrum 
    ~rigryx-sovrus
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]:  
    ~novrud-hanweb 
    ~radred-bitlet 
    ~bishus-namsum 
    ~nimtep-dibteb 
    ~hobmed-hinrym
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]:   
    ~bitfer-worwyd 
    ~talsur-todres 
    ~tomsyt-balsen 
    ~nocheb-talren 
    ~rovsyp-hatbep
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]:  
    ~nibbus-sivnex 
    ~dovwyn-hobsub
    ~nocheb-talren is in the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and these are the ranks of the faithful, etc,
    etc
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which is not to say that others are faithless
    equals."
                                                                                                                                                                                     
    ~wacrel-ripwes "Salo" has left the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is simply that it is now too late to win a
    carrier for mere loyalty
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: 
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: furthermore, imagine how horrible it would be
    if we were to announce that in 6 months
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: records of your loyalty would be reviewed and
    further carriers would be issued to those with demonstrated loyalty
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: let's just say it would profoundly kill the
    buzz
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and we try not to do that
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: thus, we cannot offer any details about the
    next virtue to be rewarded
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: except that it will be something useful :-)
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and those who have received carriers for
    loyalty will hopefully continue to display it, but if they don't
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there is nothing we can or will do about it
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": thank you for this honor!
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" was envisioning something with ninjas.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: (well, technically we could, but it would
    impair the integrity of Urbit)
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": Like what happens when the hoon parser sees an ASCII 9
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": so how can I help urbit?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] takes this moment to thank everyone who has
    shown up and contributed
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: can you code?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: probably, or you wouldn't be here
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": hear! hear!
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu":  arditi ninjas toting vials of castor oil, in
    keeping with the theme
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]  salutes the new captains of the imperial
    fleet
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you can learn the system and apply your fresh
    youthful perspective to it
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there will be much to be done, relatively soon
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": nope, i can't code worth beans
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu"  can't code but knows he should fix that
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that's fine, y'all can learn!
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": i'm in the same boat as dolrux, metaphorically
    speaking
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": Speaking for 
    ~lontec-botrum, who is with us in spirit, thanks!
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: our great advantage here is that there is
    nothing to unlearn
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: those who can code basically have to unlearn
    half the things they now
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: know
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": your minds are fresh, untainted with the 20th-century
    perspectives.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: because this system is just plain weird.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: exactly.
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: And if you can't code Hoon after reading
    the doc, that's a bug in either Hoon or the doc, not you...
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] loves using "20th-century" as a pejorative.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that's exactly right, the customer is never
    wrong
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": yeah, I wonder if urbit is /too/ weird, honestly
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is really not a very complex system and if
    it seems scary, we're doing it wrong
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: well, the idea is that young people are the
    future and weird attracts young people
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: seems to mostly work
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: No computer has ever failed to run a
    program for being too weird, so far as I know.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": what about graphical applications and such? shiny
    GUIs, and games?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: with some exceptions...
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we are a long way from that
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and quite intentionally
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: someone should really right a MUD for urbit
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the neat thing about the niche of personal
    cloud computing
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: *write, not right
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: stupid fingers
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: is that the shiny chrome stuff is neither
    needed nor wanted
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we're really just serving web pages like very
    other back end
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: all the shiny is in the browser
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a lot of people (Alan Kay comes to mind) who
    have tried the total rewrite
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": so who is urbit /made/ for?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: have gotten stuck on this giant bolus of work
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": end users, or backend people?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that depends what year it is
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you ask excellent questions, young man, you
    ought to be a VC
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: in the year 2014, urbit is for: geeks.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" is interested in writing a MU* for urbit, in fact.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: who bought an Apple II in 1982?  certainly not
    anyone who needed an Apple II.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it was a new computing form factor
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": a VC?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: venture capitalist
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan] can betatest the heck out of MU*'s
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Charlie don't invest.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: ha
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": in the beginning, there were BBSes, MUDs, and
    pre-IRC chats...
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: yes. MUDs were my gateway into the
    hilarious netherworld of distributed systems software.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but in any case, basically, for examples of
    people using cloud computers
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you have apps like Buffer
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which is a multigazillion funded VC business
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which exists to run a cron job that posts your
    tweets to Twitter
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": heh
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so a lot of people have in a sense cloud
    computers
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": how did you learn to code, tasfyn?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but there are basically two kinds of cloud
    computers
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: taught myself on a 3B1 with a 10Mhz 68010 :-)
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": heh
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there are general-purpose cloud computers and
    special-purpose ones
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Buffer is a special-purpose cloud computer, so
    is Facebook
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: somebody else owns your data, controls your
    programs, owns your identity
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": how would you learn to code these days?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this kind of sucks especially if you're a
    privacy freak
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": Start with Nock!
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I can recommend only one system, which is the
    one you're using
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Nock doc rocks, ~tognex.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: all others fail our highly technical quality
    test
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": unix system programming is not any fun to teach
    anyone.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there is another kind of cloud computer
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": well, i might like something usable for end users
    within the next ten years
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it's the linux box you can get at DO or AWS
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] is going as fast as he can...
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it's great if you're a linux sysadmin and enjoy
    doing that in your spare time
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: It's fun in the "and you'll never believe
    *this*" sense of teaching people things.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but the advantage of Urbit
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: is that it's both as general-purpose as the
    Linux box
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and as simple as the special-purpose things
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": OMG.  A 3B1.  My parents had a (I think) 3B1.
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: behold:
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Atandt_unix_pc.jpg
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the whole stack from nock up to the OS is well
    under 15000 lines of code
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": has anyone seen any blues, or am the onlly blue on
    urbit
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT"  learned to program on the Univac 70/46 at the local
    college.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": *am i the
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it's quite possible that you've stumbled into a
    hive of dangerous heretics, tognex
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] is not really %black, but is spying on the
    %black channel
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but that is neither here nor there and you
    don't need to worry about it!
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: "Trust half of what you see and none of
    what you hear."
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you're probably looking for some other droids.
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: all i need is a little bit of
    time and i will understand hoon
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": heh, I'm fairly sure this is the conspiracy I came
    for.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: in any case
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: everyone loves conspiracies especially the
    younger set
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: yes
    ~rigryx-sovrus "atax2a": You came here looking for us? We're flattered. And now
    you're implicated... ;)
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and come on, you already have a secret codename
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: what could go wrong?
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": LOL
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: cabal-oriented development is what spurred
    my interest in open source.
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu"  learned to program in QuickBASIC on an IBM clone
    running win3.1 about ten years ago
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but in any case, the way urbit will work for
    the ordinary user
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: is that all the 15 or 20 web apps you use on a
    regular basis now
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: will cease to exist
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu"  forgot all that, which is probably for the best
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: they will become without form and void
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: weeping and gnashing of teeth will be heard on
    Sand Hill Road
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: good
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: except of course for the prescient investors
    who presciently invested in us instead
    ~monder-navryx "LarryH": amen
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: tumblr is one of the webapps
    i use
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: and i hate it
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and instead of these webapps
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": yeah tasfyn, I'm seriously doubting the sanity of
    urbit, but what's the fun in a sane conspiracy?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you will run your own demons
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: on your own ship
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which serves only you
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i don't think anyone but
    dolrux can understand how much i hate tumblr
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: "as a service" is 2014's "dot tumblr dot
    com".
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which has only your data
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which is yours
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": labfes, tumblr should have its own banner to contain
    the insanity
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: sure, it's hosted, but you could also host it
    yourself
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: or move it between providers
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: because it's yours
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and when you want to change the program you're
    running
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you just do that
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and... and this only works, critical point
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: if we can leverage the simplicity of the
    architecture
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: to make system administration *absolutely
    trivial*
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": Huzzah!
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: owning an urbit ship should be as easy as
    managing your iphone, if not easier
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so this is basically the personal use case
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: can we get it to run on a
    mobile device
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: will there be a touchscreen
    UI
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": The serverside shouldn't.
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i've got a nice ssh app on my iphone
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so eventually, once you have these ships in the
    cloud
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen": <- comes to you from an android today
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: once world domination is achieved or at least
    threatened on the server side
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: you probably _could_, if you're energetic
    enough. But the idea is that an urbit ship is your agent in a datacenter
    somewhere
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: some amount of cutting through the browser on
    the client will be inevitable
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": heh, plotting world domination already
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you'll have a destroyer on the server and then,
    later, a yacht (64-bit ship) on the client
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" keeps reminding people: everyone has a web browser and
    an email address.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is 40, he needs to hurry up with that sh*t
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but as hatteb said
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: and your android device is both short of
    battery and intermittent of connection, and you usually want some service
    running on your behalf on something further from the network edge.
                                                                                                                                                                                     
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] is interested in doing the cloud on your
    phone, some day...
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the first step is to take advantage of the
    network effect of existing networks
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": 40 is the new 20.
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: so http
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so, basically, your ship serves http apps to
    you
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": a way to transfer files easily between urbit users
    would be nice
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": what about clouds in my coffee?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: heh, this is not only nice but trivial
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: if you've seen the video
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": then again, you'd probably attract all the pirates
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: urbit is a global namespace
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" is one of those maniacs that has an IRC editor. :)
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": ever
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you really ought to be a VC, young man
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: when you grow up of course 
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: is there a toolkit for
    defining http services
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: or will we need to build one
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but in this global namespace you can use files
    on other peoples ships just by using them
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there is but it's somewhat prototypic
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this is %eyre, arvo/eyre.hoon
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: ok so we'll need to build
    from it
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen" has left the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it serves a little toy app but it's somewhat of
    a toy
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] wants his web apps to be as easy to edit and run
    as php.
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i want easier
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": there was a guy in the pre-compuserve days who said
    he'd figure that the whole modem thing was useful when he could go on his
    computer and look up a nything he might want to know about manatees
                                                                                                                                                                                     
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: how could we be easier?
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: well for one: screw html
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: in any case, I don't expect to attract pirates
    at first
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": anyway, I don't think I'm rich enough to be a
    venture capitalist, tasfyn
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: oh yes, you can generate html easily as simply
    a noun
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: heh, you use other peoples' money
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": letters of marque and reprisal?
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": and in the other case, our network is slow enough to
    not make piracy easy.
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": ...i forget where i was going with that
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": At the current moment, at least.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes - it's basically not as good a BitTorrent
    as BitTorrenty
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: anyway everyone's doing this
    RESTful BS these days
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: if BT didn't exist we might have a problem
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": yes, but you have to convince people to give you
    their money
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": that's the hard part
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes, this requires social connections
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you have to get to know people who know people
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you know me and I know people, so...
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: actually you should consider applying for a
    Thiel Fellowship at some point 
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: tomsyt-balsen is a veteran of this program
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: if you're not cool enough you have 5 years to
    become more cool
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: still has the scars
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but you're here so you must be cool eh.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: anyway my 40-year-old wrists are getting tired
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: if anyone has any technical questions from
    reading the doc
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: or questions about the carrier distribution
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" 's wrists are unhappy too :(
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] would be pleased to entertain them.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hatteb, just you wait.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": pfft, I'm not going to become a loyal servant of the
    cultspiracy of urbit just because you said I was cool :P
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: sitting wrong kills wrists
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you can say that, but...
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": I do have one question, lemme go find tha deets...
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: one of my friends has
    invincible wrists
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] knows very well how to run a cult.
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu":  labfes, replacing the html/css/js hell would be an
    interesting exercise
    ~ladhut-docfyn [Dan Haffey]: could you give a micro-summary of tiles for the
    doc-impatient?
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Off-topic: When is your birthday, ~tasfyn?
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": there are people who use normal sensible things like
    linux and python who think I'm cool :P
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: heh.
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": would probably take a few decades to work it out,
    but, hey, you know
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a tile is a structured way to create a noun of
    a well-known type
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu"  wonders if there's an existing format that could be
    used to replace it
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a tile is used either for (a) creating a
    default noun, (b) applying type to an untyped noun, (c) a pattern matching test
    ~ladhut-docfyn [Dan Haffey]: awesome, thanks
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT"  is reminded of the scene from the American "Office" where
    Creed Bratton allows as how cults are fun -- being a leader is good, but a lot
    of work, and bei ng a member has its good points too, or words to that effect.
                                                                                                                                                                                     
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: dolrux, once we come up with
    a way to build native UIs easily
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this will be the next doc output, give me a day
    or two
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": you know what I'd like? a really, really good
    terminal
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: as for the native UIs
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu"  thought of svg and is now cackling maniacally
    imagining that
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] dreams of sending only SVG over the nets
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": one wth features like a list of files to the right,
    or something
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu"  isn't even sure if that'd be better or worse
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but SVG compatibility she is not so great
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: svg is a monster of a format
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes, we'll basically have a web
    dashboard/console
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: interactivity is the punch in
    the crotch
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": one made not to resemble a teletype terminal
    intentionally, but be new and better.
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: j a v a s c r i p t
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: to control your ship not using SSH or whatever
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": <troll>we can always use VRML</troll>
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: someone had the bright idea that xml was just
    perfect for vector graphics
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": xml (^:
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is probably too old to know how to reinvent the
    terminal - but yes.
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": for all x someone had the bright idea that xml was
    just perfect for x
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] cut his teeth on the vt100.
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: having multiple ways to add
    properties to object structure isn't normal, but on xml it is
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" does know that Xterm has a vector-display emulator...
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: xml: not even once
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I actually was reading Usenet on an
    amber-screen VT100 in 1988
    ~ladhut-docfyn [Dan Haffey]: dolrux, I was typing almost the same thing :)
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yeah, xml and vector graphics == hilarious fit
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: okay, we have no critical questions
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": everyone in my family works in tech, and once every
    two weeks or so one of them brings back a new xml horror story
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: there was an amusing bug in
    the JVM, speaking of XML, recently
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: which we discovered because
    apparently all the AWS apis use XML
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": i'm gonna be going a bit idle. good luck with urbit,
    tasfyn! maybe it'll be the future, maybe not. maybe something similar will be.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]:  dolrux, hopefully one day Alan Kay will
    disgorge the work his team has been working on for the past few years, he's
    basically been doing for graphics/UIs what Urbit is doing for
    cloud/distributed/server stuff
                                                                                                                                                                                     
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is going to go home, put his kids to bed and ice
    his wrists :-)
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: (i.e., a rewrite from foundations)
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: he encourages the conversation to continue!
    ~monder-navryx "LarryH": ~tasfyn, did i read in one of the logs that there is a
    known problem with getting notified of updates to the file system
    ~minbec-wansyl [Michael (mhartl) Hartl]:  Have a good night
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": Good night, Curtis!  Thanks again!
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: actually I say that, I know some of it's
    public... hunting for it
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: monder-navryx you read that right
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: so basically there was a
    security feature the java devs added to prevent XML entity expansion attacks
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: quitting and restarting vere will always get
    it, though...
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: anyway, good night!
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Vale, Czyarvin.
    ~monder-navryx "LarryH": have tried that, will try again
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: night!
    ~balweb-sarlyt [Mark Zavislak]: Have a great night ~tasfyn, my kid needs to get
    to bed too.
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": night
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: so they put a cap of 6400
    expansion by default. however, the broken part ...
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: was that they were using a
    GLOBAL VARIABLE to count up how many expansions had been done!
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": bonsoir
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: so there could only be 6400
    expansions during the lifetime of the JVM!
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has left the building
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": ahaha 
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: 6400 should be enough for anybody
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": heh! i'm the youngest in the cultspiracy of urbit,
    probably
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan] might still be the oldest
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4":   ~tognex, you have competition.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": oh?
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4":   It will probably come down to the difference of a few
    months.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": well then
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": how old are you?
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: DMT beats me by five years, I
    gratefully relinquish the crown
    ~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc] has left the building
    ~nocheb-talren has left the building
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": fantyv, how old are you?
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": 
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": No fear from me, I was born right after the fall of the
    USSR.
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu":  my first memory is hearing about the breakup of
    yugoslavia
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": who's my competition, then?
    ~nimsup-losseb "DMT": No idea.  My early memories involve hearing about the
    Kennedy assasination.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Haven't seen them on in a while.
    ~minbec-wansyl [Michael (mhartl) Hartl] has left the building
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": My earliest memories consist of trying to climb out
    of a crib.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Goes by the name of Setra.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": I'm fairly sure they're real.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" remembers an earthquake in California dominating news
    coverage.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": And a lot of familial stuff not worth recounting.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": All memories are real. Whether they are of real things
    is another question.
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: my earliest memories are
    about a nightmare i used to have
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": heh, I'm pretty sure it was of a real thing
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": Do you remember that time we were on Urbit?
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": The one where dinosaurs stalk your church and you have
    to run away from them by sneaking around the back to make a dash to the parking
    lot, but everythi ng seemed to be going in slow motion?
                                                                                                                                                                                     
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": That nightmare?
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: it involved getting eaten
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": atax1a, November of 2013.
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: by a piece of wall furniture
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Quick question, was my last post prepended with "..."?
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": No.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": That's a terminal artefact.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": just ignore the ellipsis...
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Very curious, it looks like "... atax1a, November of
    2013".
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": that's my policy anyway
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Yes, I suspect xterm strangeness.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": It's probably not xterm.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": The ... is :chat waiting on an ack from ~doznec, so i
    hear.
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu":  yeah if it's there when you hit enter it'll look
    like it's there when it sends
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": since it just bumps whatever's on the bottom up one,
    i think
    ~rovsyp-hatbep [Aaron Beckerman] has left the building
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Interesting.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": yeah, the ... is waiting for a server reply 't be
    held against them as employees
                                                                                                                                                                                     
       attacked through an employer.
                                                                                                                                                                                     
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i'm thinking of running through some project
    euler problems in hoon
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": It seems like a good fit.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": hoon is the high-level part, right?
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": Hoon is the systems language.
      %orange history and my more %black present.
                                                                                                                                                                                     
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Hoon : Nock :: C : Assembly
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": Ok.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": so hoon is the highest level?
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": So far.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": I really do recommend learning Nock first.
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": I agree
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" tried the other way, it doesn't work so well.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": how hard is nock?
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Are you familiar with binary trees?
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": nope
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" has left the building
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": i don't really know much code
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": No need to know code, tree manipulation is the
    mechanical explanation of what nock does.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": A binary tree is a graph composed of a set of points
    (equivalently, nodes) and lines.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": There is a single root node, which can connect to at
    most two child nodes.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": These child nodes are the parents of up to at most two
    child nodes.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Like so:     Root
    /    \
    ch ild  child
                                                                                                                                                                                     
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": These nodes have indexes, numbers which identify their
    address within the tree.

    ~ladhut-docfyn [Dan Haffey]: the root is 1
    ~ladhut-docfyn [Dan Haffey]: if you're talking / indexes
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Thank you, ~ladhut.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": If you have never encountered trees or other data
    structures, the only action that will be of much help is to go and learn them,
    for which Nock is quite suitable.
                                                                                                                                                                                     
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": k
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": If you do, then the mantra that Nock is a way to
    manipulate binary trees of integers helps to burn away the mysticism.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": i see...
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" is in the building
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": There is also a correspondence between trees and lists.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": What do you see: ()
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": i see that i need to learn trees
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: who here likes to cook
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4" enjoys en masse jumbalaya production.
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]:  @was a stunning cook, now a
    stunning primal cook
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: who screws up half his emotes
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: it's like 5 past 23 here and
    i'm cooking up some bacon some sweet potato oven fries and some eggs
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Stunningly primal good sir
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": i like to cook
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" has left the building
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": we got to hold another urbit meetup
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": from 2014-01-22 on
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: going afk for a moment
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" is in the building
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Do I interpret your proposal, ~racbes, to mean the
    establishment of a Perpetual Urbit Party?
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": *your proposal correctly
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": "What: Party Where: Urbit When: 2014-01-22 til ?"
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": that's right
    ~ladhut-docfyn [Dan Haffey]: ain't no party like a west coast party
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": it can have like intervals...
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": I hesitate to define a particular interval
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": The Party of the Institutionalized Urbivolution.
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": but clearly urbit must colonize additional times and
    places
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": in addition to Zeitgeist on 2014-01-20 
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: ahhh, back
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Transportation costs would be the limiting factor for
    me.
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": first, Mr. Dee and I are going to armwrestle for our
    respective monastic traditions
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": I don't know who's holding the bets
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: helping someone through urbit over skype is
    interesting
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": do you know if :game is working ~tomsyt?
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i kept wanting to grab the keyboard
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: but there was no keyboard
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: does it say waiting?
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": no... type fail
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: ah, you need to run "game" and then a string
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": i read it as taking a tape...
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: :game "elvis"
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: should work
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": that works for you?
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": i get a type-fail down in hume... wanted to make sure it
    wasn't just me
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: ...no, that's bizarre
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: that should work though
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": i tried on two different destroyers... same thing
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Once Urbit has games, we can form UGGs - Urbit Gamer
    Guilds.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": And with our UGGs, we can play in the MUD.
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i'm stumped
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: hang on
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": These are the lines of code implicated by the stack
    trace:
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB":     =+  gat=(slap ras [%cnbc %give])
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB":             *************************
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": i'm gonna e-mail cgy
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: ah, i know what's going on
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: it's a language change propagation error
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: as in, cgy changed something in hoon
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": ah.. that was my guess
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and hasn't changed game
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: okay guys, i'm heading out for the night
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": i don't remember seeing any app level changes...
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": g'night
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": good night jcb
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: see you around the urb
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Vale.
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": I'm in ur town next Wednesday giving u cheez
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: can't wait
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: bye
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: is this what we're supposed
    to do when we visit tlon?
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: bring cheese?
    ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: or similar things?
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm": no, I am uniquely cheese-privileged

    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Yeah, I had shut down the n&
    earlier when it was stuck on ...'ing
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": maybe it's novrud that needs restarting
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": i'm writing a -p into v/main.c
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": does anyone know what -k and -f do
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": -k is "boot stage", an int between 0 and 256
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": so, a char-sized int
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": -f is only allowed to be a max of 100 but is

    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": You can run it but you'll be waiting about 30 more
    seconds
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": two more seconds
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: All is well

    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": does anyone here know what a c3_w is
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": w must stand for word
    ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm": 3 could stand for 3 omitted letters
    ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm": so it could be, say, "cuss_word"
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": well, let's find out if I did it even remotely
    right...
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: so I think I absorbed some of the hoon
    docs.

    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": Remotely right is about where it's at!
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": cool
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": I'm working in c right now
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: always fun
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" is in the building
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: the nice thing about C is that it's so bad
    nobody expects you to do it without reasonable tools.
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": include/c/types.h:11:      typedef uint32_t c3_w;
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": 80:   typedef unsigned int      uint32_t;
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": appears to be an unsigned in
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": int
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": oh perfect
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": just enough to store a long port number
    ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm" has left the building
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": so it takes my param to -p
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": but it complains that the pier is already created,

    ~wacrel-ripwes "Salo" has left the building
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": ok, so it actually did work

    did
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": make clean && make -j4
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": and I can still get a random port by not passing in -p

    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": dash, it's & yes 
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] does not fear the DO.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: although their "private networking" option is

    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" is in the building
    ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm" has left the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] admires dondep's pastebin, although ^-  is
    basically cast
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" has left the building
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" reads ^- as "returns this type"
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] always says "produces," never says "returns"
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] isn't sure why
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but with ^-, we of course have to test that the
    thing it produces without the ^-  matches the actual product
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this is ++nest which will be explained in
    chapter 10
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" ...in what base
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so it is not a weak cast in the C sense, it is
    fully type safe
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: all your base is belong to tasfyn-partyv.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" uses base 10, but can only count up to 3
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] left octal out of his syntax
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": probably a good thing - nobody uses octal, and it
    confuses newcomers.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the word is cool, though.  octal.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it could be a hipster baby name.
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" is in the building
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": it's five letters, though.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": %octl
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] didn't give either of his kids four-letter
    names, he's not sure why
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: at some point he'll have to break the bad news
    that they don't fit in a c3_w
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": The horror.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Henry and Sibyl, correct? Drop the (canonical) vowels
    and it works.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but the four-letter words don't drop vowels -
    once you start abbreviating it never stops.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": %o
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": So, last era I had a :thumb that would read your bud's
    plan. But I never got it to type as a tape correctly.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": It seemed more like a *'', which makes me think of
    tainted data in a perly sense.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the file itself would be a big ass atom
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is certainly not a tape (list of
    characters), that would be insanely bulky
    ~ladhut-docfyn [Dan Haffey] has left the building
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": of course.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": but my dot-plan is a file containing utf8 text, in
    something like the old unix tradition.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes.  it makes a fine atom.  any file is an
    atom./
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ++lore will split your file up into a list of
    spans, one for each line
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": oho.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: actually looking at ++lore is a good simple
    little hoon exercise
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" has left the building
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": those cut and end functions scare me a bit. 
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": but i grok turn, and envision the 
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" peeked forward and read role...
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" is in the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: cut and end are thoroughly jet propelled, in
    case you worry that they're slow
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" doesn't worry about speed.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] doesn't do speed, he sticks with caffeine
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": they are used a lot, and i don't yet understand what
    /for/.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: he used to have a big bottle of ephedrine when
    you could get that
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: cut and end are bit surgery with an adjustable
    block size
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: (cut 3 [a b] c) == give me the bytes starting
    at a, for a length of b, from c
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": pick out pieces of atoms, then?
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": oho.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": why 3?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: 3 == bytes
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: (1 << 3) == 8
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": oh dang
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": okay
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there are 8 bits in a byte
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": there are indeed
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: 0 == bits
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: 13 == Kbytes
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: etc.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": so that gets bex'd to make the block size
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": gotcha/
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" has left the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: those who talk don't know, those who know don't
    talk
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" tries to figure out what ^+ and ^= do, now...
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" is in the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ^=  a  b is just the regular form of a=b
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ^+ is a cast to a twig instead of a tile
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: tile doc coming soon
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" vaguely recalls mention of the regular form in the twig
    doc...
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it will all form a beautiful picture in your
    mind
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": So, lore: given an atom, produce a list of lines - if
    the atom is 0, reverse the accumulated list, otherwise recursively do bit
    surgery.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": (accumulating into a list, of course)
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes we accumulate in reverse for obvious
    reasons
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it hardly matters because you see the ~/ there
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": right.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the jet is on
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": hello again tasfyn
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": hi tognex
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: good morning tognex
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it's morning here, where are you?
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": morning :)
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you're not another of those Indiana kids are
    you?
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": at a place where it's 11:40 am
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": ha, nope
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": Mountain time!
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ah, denver.  go buy some weed for me, there's a
    good boy.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": not denver. idaho :U
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": no weed, but I can get you some potatoes?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: idaho is much cooler actually
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": oh?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has fantasies of moving his family to idaho to
    escape from the moral decay of san francisco
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": moral decay?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but really his kids would just grow up smoking
    meth instead of weed.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a couple of months ago I was coming out the
    front door of Tlon Global Headquarters
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a block from the Twitter building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: dude was in my way, in the doorway
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: shooting heroin
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" would try meth, if e knew e could just do it once.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: literally with a blood filled needle in his arm
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I'm like, dude, I kinda need to get through
    here...
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": shrug
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": but, if i did, i'd do it 'once' over the course of 6
    months, and... no good.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] will become a heroin addict on his deathbed.
    maybe with some meth thrown in.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] 
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": people can slowly kill themselves however they want,
    imo
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] 's kids go to school two blocks away, he has to
    explain the shambling zombies to a 3 year old
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it's a very interesting phenomenon
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: how did you hear about urbit, tognex?
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": from a friend
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" did too.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you're checking the "on the internets" box
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": where did this friend come from?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] wants people to hear about urbit the same way
    they get their weed
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": shrug, it was a guy i know in a private irc channel
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the buzzword would be virally rather than
    through a media push
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen" is in the building
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": oooh, people still use irc?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that would definitely be viral transmission
    which is ideal
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": showed me the documentation to laugh at the oddity
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm" is in the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hatteb is joking fyi
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": heh, figured as much
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that's exactly how it should work
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" is pleased that young'uns are on the IRCs, though.
    Especially when the IRCs lead to urbit :chat.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: young geeks are always looking for something
    that isn't boring and lame
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": exactly
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] remembers the greatness of Usenet, tognex has
    probably never heard of it
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": PFFT
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": i've heard of usenet.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] was posting on usenet in 1989 when he was
    tognex's age.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": i do know a bit of computer history.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: unfortunately he didn't realize that records
    would be kept
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I know about ancient Rome too, but I never went
    there
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" has left the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: what's most depressing is the way it turned
    into a sewer of pr0n binaries
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" missed usenet and became part of the Eternal September.
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": I grew up on IRC, with the programmers of
    enlightenment 
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] used to maintain the group killfile for his
    favorite newsgroup
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but that was when you could kill them one by
    one
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": i never would have found out about urbit without
    minecraft, actually
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a rifle was sufficient
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] would love to have something like a minecraft
    server on his urbits
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: minecraft and DF have the true ethos of
    computing I grew up with
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: DF == Dwarf Fortress
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": a long, long time ago, I went to the minecraft
    modding irc channel
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": and my life was forever ruined/enhanced, depending
    on who you ask.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": yeah, I know what dwarf fortress is, I've even
    played it :P
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: do you go to high school, tognex?  or are you
    homeschooled?
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" is in the building
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": homeschooled
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: how did I know that?
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": in high school, i ran a proxy to avoid the pervasive
    filtering by the district.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: is it christian homeschooling or hippie
    homeschooling?
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": christian homeschooling
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": oof.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": of the not very existent sort. mostly, I teach
    myself things!
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": Curtis, did you or John look at my c change in that
    PR#108
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": not-so-oof!
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which has its merits, but they are probably
    hard to see at your age
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": which... i'm kinda lazy about.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: john also was homeschooled at your age, look
    how he turned out
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": you can at least tell yourself that you're learning
    urbit, right?
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": I'm worried that's not the right way to get a command
    line argument
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": mostly because I don't know how the optargs part works
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] was sent to an American high school as a
    12-year-old sophomore, it was completely insane
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] will look at the change when he finishes
    interrogating tognex
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" takes a look at satnum's PR.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": so are you the main urbit person?
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": that's fine
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes, indeed I built this crazy thing pretty
    much
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it was entirely my project until this summer
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": it's the -p port option we were talking about
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": i tried to follow your lead with -k
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: what is the option for, satnum?  refresh my
    memory
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": my network has (I thought we proved) a strange rule
    that says ports 59000-60000 are special UDP ports
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": allowed, where the others are silently dropped
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you can also see other my dangerous internet
    cult being attacked here:
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]:
    http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/22/geeks-for-monarchy/
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": satnum, that looks reasonable to me.
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": so it was an option to pick the port that ames listens
    on
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": hatteb, thanks
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it's obviously ideal if you can join both cults
    at the same time.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: gotcha
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] trusts hatteb's judgment.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": haha, you actually call it a dangerous internet
    cult?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has great faith in the powers of satire.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": knew I shouldn't trust urbit. weird terms and alien
    documentation!
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: always trust content from Tlon Corporation
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": martians are your neighbors
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": not like those far away alians
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but it really is the case that both arms of my
    plot for world domination are now doing... something
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": don't trust folks from Uranus
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": one arm is making an art project, and the other is
    stirring up neoreaction.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": or so say the detractors.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": world domination is an ugly phrase
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is good to be understated by the enemy
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": you should aim for world optimization
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] grew up a Washington brat and always likes to
    ask people in that culture
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": people keep asking if urbit is going to make computers
    more intuitive
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: "what exactly is the difference between
    providing global governance and seizing world domination?"
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the Paypal mafia with which I'm sort of
    remotely connected introduced the "world domination" meme
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] also has a Darth Vader action figure which his
    wife gave him for Christmas
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": what is the goal of urbit
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] has left the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: world domination of course!
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": I made this great ruby thing using inotify and tail
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": mhmm. and what's the reason behind that goal?
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": I'm really proud of it! Called logblaster... no
    laughing
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the world is always dominated by someone or
    something
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: at present it is dominated by two things
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: one, software from the 1970s
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: two, government from the 1930s
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: both of these things were very old when I was
    young
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I am no longer young and they still seem old
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and they do not taste good to me
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": Software from the 1970s is fascinating in a morbid
    sort of way
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: they seem a little stale, funky, been in the
    fridge too long
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so why not clean the fridge eh?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: besides it's my nature as a rootless
    cosmopolitan international Jew
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: to disrupt every stable social system I find
    myself in
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": be careful not to take out all the shelves, mmk?
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": they're kind of useful.
    ~wacrel-ripwes "Salo" is in the building
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" has a fixation on reading boot routines from operating
    systems - small steps loading bigger steps and eventually BAM, an OS happens.
    ~rovrel-bicmyl has left the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes we're going to burn the old furniture, but
    we'll have new furniture
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": the old furniture is crawling with bedbugs and
    scabies.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is not opposed to software, just the software we
    have
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": but will you be replacing comfy recliners with
    barstools?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is not opposed to government, just the
    government we have
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] becomes 
    ~hobmed-hinrym
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: comfy recliners crawling with bedbugs
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee] is in the building
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: hmm
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" has left the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: people in the comfy recliners can still sit in
    them
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" itches every time he has to reach in to the persistence
    table - it's a bottomless pit swarming with bees.
    ~rovrel-bicmyl is in the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: they have bedbugs anyway so who cares
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: initially the barstools are a little bit
    uncomfortable
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" is in the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: over time they grow backs and cushions, etc
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": i see.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you can't go straight to the comfy recliner, it
    is simply not doable from an engineering standpoint
    ~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] has left the building
    ~wacrel-ripwes "Salo" has left the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but good metaphor btw...
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: tognex, where are you in Idaho, north or
    south?
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": south, dondep
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] continues to think tognex should be a VC when he
    grows up.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": Why would you wish such a fate on someone, tasfyn? :)
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Aha. I have some friends in northern
    Idaho, was wantingto see how small the world actually was. :)
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] was in wyoming this summer for a VC sponsored
    retreat, probably not too far away
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": oh please, I'm trying to sound smarter than I am :p
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": if anyone is interested in a "annotated chat" that shows
    the rawish server messages as they come in
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] is in the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: like everything, there are good ones and bad
    ones
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": try :
    ~wacrel-ripwes/main/cp1/bin/achat
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: hatteb, it's more about the fate he's
    wishing on future software developers :)
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has spent 40 years trying to sound smarter than
    he is, it's one of the core VC skills btw
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" always worries about sounding like a fool.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: are you planning on going to college early,
    tognex, or waiting till the usual age?
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm" has left the building
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": I don't know if I'll go to college yet, tasfyn.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that's an even better decision
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" was about to say, "are you planning on going to college
    at all?".
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": I probably will. But I might just become a
    bartender. You never know.
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm" is in the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: did your parents' ideology/religion take on
    you, or have you rebelled against it?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: or a bit of both?
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: tasfyn, hey, some of us managed to do both
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": ha! their ideology and mine are miles away
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: heh yes
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] grew up in a communist/atheist family so he
    never had that conflict
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": i'm rather good at hiding that, though :P
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] understands this but suggests tolerance, one day
    it will make a little more sense to you
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": so, are /you/ trying to take over the world, or are
    you trying to make /urbit/ take over the world
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": easily the worst experience i had growing up was
    spending time at a bible camp...
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: oh the latter, really
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I essentially want the world to take over
    itself
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I really don't enjoy ruling people or anything,
    it's an enormous pain in the butt
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": and yes, the world will become Tlon.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] might try to raise his kids as Christians,
    despite not being one himself
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": so you're just aiming for world optimization
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: except that his wife had to go to bible camp
    and would never tolerate it
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: sure.  world optimization, that's a fine term
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": nice job wacrel-ripwes
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": heh, don't do that. raise them as good people.
    that's all you should do, in my opinion
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": if they want to follow an old, rather funky smelling
    religion, that's their personal choice
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has settled on sending them to Chinese school,
    they get the fascist thing right
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": now define "good".
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm" has left the building
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": thanks 
    ~satnum-maptux... (wacrel-ripwes is up on DO so it stays up all the time)
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" frantically gestures to indicate that this is merely a
    thought exercise.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: basically the cause of the funky smell
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": I have two machines that are up all the time
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: is that when you have anything that the best
    people leave, the not-so-best will remain
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": One of them runs FreeBSD, I had a bad enough time last
    time I tried running vere on it that I haven't tried again
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: old things do not have to smell funky
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but they will inevitably smell funky if they
    are populated only by mediocrities
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": no, they don't
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": 32-bit freebsd, virtualized in kvm
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and all the cool people have left
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: when you look at American evangelical
    Christianity
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": but some old things /do/ smell rather funky
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it has suffered this fate in the extreme
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: all of Christianity has suffered this fate -
    basically all of the ancient world
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm" is in the building
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": satnum, vere runs well enough on 9.1-amd64, and I
    think I localized the bad performance to my config.
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB": fancy... i just stick with stock Ubuntu
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we cannot help but observe its funkiness, which
    is acutely obvious especially to the young and bright
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and of course, there is a silliness to any
    ancient myth
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": the machine I have in front of me, and the machine
    that runs novrud-hanweb, are real live ubuntu machines
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: on the other hand, there is a silliness to a
    large number of modern myths
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": modern myths like Unix.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": christianity is such a wide border that there are
    all kinds of things under it, funky, non-funky, extremely funky
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which do not smell funky, simply because the
    best and brightest people believe in them
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": What sort of christianity are your parents into,
    tognex?
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: unix is less of a myth, more of a
    cautionary tale
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this is also true
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": not sure. tiny church
    ~racbes-solmun "kpm" has left the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it still can be classified on the Christian
    equivalent of the Unix History Poster
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": fairly tolerant, or so they say, but mum complains
    about the gays/etc and moral decline of society
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" is familiar with this type of branch. "Love the sinner
    hate the sin", for the gays?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: well, there's moral decline and moral decline
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] knows some pretty moral gays
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" knows some pretty immoral hets.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: on the other hand, his 3-year-old son's first
    really coherent sentence was:
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]  is debugging a pretty immoral Python test
    suite.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: "Pop, why do... dangerous persons [meaning San
    Francisco's indigenous zombies]... have shopping carts?"
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" thinks python test suites are amoral, not immoral...
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I actually am familiar with all the stages of
    moral decline
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": "to trap little children like you inside, naturally"
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: hatteb, you haven't seen this one
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": remember to traumatize your children, parents.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: first a young teenager runs away from his
    intolerant Christian parents in, let's say, Idaho
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": if you don't leave the psychological scars, WHO
    WILL?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: he comes to the Haight-Ashbury which is
    basically where I live
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: (you have the right idea, tog.)
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the weather is good here, you can live on the
    street
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: buy weed by the ounce and sell it by the eight
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: have a little yellow dog on a leash, put out a
    sign and ask for change
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it's cool, it's fun
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the future is full of possibility
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: all your life possessions are in a backpack
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it's a big backpack and over time it gets a
    little gnarly
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and time passes
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: time passes actually pretty fast when you're
    wasted all the time
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: (and people ask me why I don't enjoy
    visiting san francisco)
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and after a few years your back doesn't work
    quite as well as it used to
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and you think:
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: gee, wouldn't this be easier
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: if I had something I could roll?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and this is why dangerous persons have shopping
    carts.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: (OTOH much of it has to do with how my car
    got towed the first time I parked on the street.)
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the basic problem is that there is no real
    society for a bright young person to grow up into
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": eh, I don't really think you should try to
    psychologically scar your children
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: for example, in medieval Florence
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: everyone was a Christian
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": INSTEAD, you should try to teach them how to think
    well.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: in fact a Catholic
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and if you were bright and talented in this
    environment
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you could grow up and become incredibly learned
    and also wealthy and successful, in fact you could be a cardinal
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: or even the Oope
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Pope
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": figure out things, learn for themselves, reason
    well.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but there is no equivalent of this in American
    tea party evangelical-Protestant churchy society
    ~rovrel-bicmyl has left the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] tends to feel that a child who can figure out
    things, etc, will, and one who can't won't
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] doubts that it can be taught, unfortunately
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Reasoning well is a skill that gets
    learned kind of late anyway
    ~rovrel-bicmyl is in the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but it certainly helps to be home-schooled with
    the entire vastness of the internets on line
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": you have to equip them to do it, though
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: well, one thing that's neat from my perspective
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" has left the building
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: there's an ocean of facts to absorb before
    there's any need to do much reasoning about them.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: is that basically everything written before
    1923 is on line
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so if you don't like 2014 and you can read and
    stuff
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Getting those organized right makes a
    bigger difference than some people realize.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there's really nothing stopping you,
    intellectually, from growing up in 1914 instead
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: for example as I like to point out
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: although perhaps this should be on the %black
    channel, but hey, it's not loaded
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: no one cares
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that if you go to your google bar and type
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: "true history of the american revolution"
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you get
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the true history of the american revolution
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: That _is_ a pretty fun little book.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: as explained by Sydney Fisher in 1903
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this history is not sold in stores
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is not taught in schools
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is not as seen on TV
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is not congenial to tea partiers
    ~sarlug-picwep "ikari" is in the building
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": you're a black-banner, tasfyn?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is not congenial to progressives
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is not really congenial to anyone but
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it happens to be, in fact, true
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": well that explains some things, heh
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: tasfyn is the archaeologist who dug up the
    black banner.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I am sort of the Karl Marx of the black banner
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it will probably take me some years to find my
    Lenin
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Over the past 5 years people have started
    noticing it a bit more.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but who knows, perhaps he's in the room, heh
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the funny thing about that TechCrunch article
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: is that the people the author accuses of
    sounding like me
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: without really any evidence whatsoever
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: are in fact two of our investors...
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": sigh, i don't think anyone else is blue ;_;
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": blue banner is a lonely place
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it's okay
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": i should have picked an interesting one instead of
    an inoffensive one
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I actually would like to have some traffic on
    the blue banner
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but it's not happening yet
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: There's benefits to being first :)
    ~sarlug-picwep "ikari" has left the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: part of the problem is that in real life
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: %blue and %red are actually the same thing
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but no one wants to admit this, so I am the
    last to force it on people
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ideally we will expand past the %black ghetto
    at some point
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": no, they're two halves of the same thing that
    constantly slap eachother and can't get along for any reason
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: well, yes and no
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there is a lot of cartoon slapping
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but it's basically friendly
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: for example, consider the word "progressive" -
    does it mean %blue or %red?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] 's grandparents were longtime CPUSA members
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": i have no idea.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: exactly.  if you can
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": hell, I didn't even know "progressives existed until
    two weeks ago
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: if you can't test whether two supposedly
    categorically different things are different
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: they are not different
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: my grandparents never used the word "communist"
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the euphemism was always "progressive"
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: about as opaque as saran wrap
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but many young people who would call themselves
    "progressive"
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: have no knowledge of this history whatsoever
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: tasfyn, keep in mind you grew up in a
    different country from tognex and I. (we have visited yours and see it on TV a
    lot, of course :)
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes that is true
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but my country is the real America
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is the ruling power
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which probably seems hard to remember at a
    Texas high-school football game or whatever
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you always feel dominated by whatever is around
    you
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is terribly irritating and oppressive to be
    a young person cursed with a high IQ
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and find yourself surrounded by football
    players, cheerleaders, Christian youth ministers, and the like
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you will find yourself going to the library and
    finding copies of the New Yorker
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" shivers.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": tasfyn, why does urbit smell funky to me?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and secreting it under your bed, like a porn
    magazine
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: what is funky about it?
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Primarily I'm referring to the fact that
    'liberal' or 'moderate' were the terms I always heard for both people favoring
    and disfavoring th e category that is better covered by 'progressive'
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: other than that it's kind of new and broken
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" got in trouble in 5th grade for putting a computer book
    inside the math textbook we were supposed to be reading.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": it feels like the design has oddities
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": and such
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it does have oddities
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but which ones?
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": The design does have oddities!
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": maybe it's just new plastic smell
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there's definitely some of that
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a lot of the OS level stuff kind of barely
    works
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": Most frequently, someone points out that "truth" is
    "backwards". My only response is to open a Unix shell and type
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": true; echo $?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: especially if you're used to mature systems
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": mmm
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: 0=yes, 1=no may have been a mistake but it's
    too late now
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: yeah well
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: what still surprises me is that we're chatting
    away on top of this stack
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": it isn't a mistake, from my perspective.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: there is nothing in hoon or arvo named
    "creat"
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: literally every character is interpreted in
    Nock, at least logically
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": and yeah, that part is quite amazing.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Ken Thompson once was asked what he'd change if
    he had to do Unix over again
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: heheh
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: dondep probably knows the answer...
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: well i've heard it two ways
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] only knows the "spell creat with two e's" answer
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] osn
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] isn't really sure why there's a creat(), anyway,
    he always just uses open() with O_CREAT
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: ok yes, that's the actual one.
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee] has left the building
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: My other favorite truncated-name story is
    about lisp
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] thinks tognex should skip college, learn to code
    and come directly to San Francisco
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": rplaca! terpri!
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the beating heart of the technology world
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yeah, lisp goes crazy with ugly names
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Sussman and Steele were building a lispy
    successor to PLANNER and CONNIVER
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: then they'll have some ugly thing and want to
    do it another ugly way, so they'll put 2 on the end of the new method
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: and were going to call it SCHEMER
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: but ITS only allowed 6 character file
    names so it was SCHEME
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] loves the block caps, they remind him of
    McNamara and the Vietnam War
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: body counts on the IBM mainframes
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: yeah.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: at some point that'll be hip again.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: well Charles Stross emulated the style
    fairly well in his Laundry novels
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: CASE NIGHTMARE GREEN etc
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": i'm wondering what'll happen if urbit destroyers all
    get used
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: all 4 billion?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there aren't 4 billion adult internet users on
    the planet
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but the real answer is:
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the price will go up
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the thing is, when you have infinite identities
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: controlling spam is impossible
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": isn't it 4-billion per cruiser? Or is that a
    misconception I have?
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": and what happens when they become infeasibly priced?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: no, that's a misconception you have
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: infeasibly as in?  my goal would be about $10
    each
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but think about how much money you send your
    ISP
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": okay.
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee] is in the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: also, a destroyer isn't necessarily an
    individual
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it's a unit of reputation, really
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": okay, what does a higher-level ship (like a
    destroyer) provide?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: one per family is probably more right than one
    per person
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" avoids coining 'reputron'.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": i mean, the only ones in here are destroyer users
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": :chat is restricted to destroyers, yes.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: hatteb, be serious, it's "reputoids".
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes, a cruiser or a carrier is really a piece
    of network infrastructure
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: not for an individual at all
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it has to be essentially a benign hierarchy
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: or at least, that's the design
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": weren't they running out of ipv4 addresses?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ha.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": they did.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": sorta.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I use this example all the time
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: they are running out of ipv4 addresses to give
    away for free
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": but ipv6 is a hot mess, and isn't really that usable.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": then again, they sell entire blocks of them
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: at some point, they may have to actually resort
    to capitalism
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" uses it anyway...
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: imagine a world in which an ipv4 address was
    your personal property
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: in this world, when you get an internet cell
    phone
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you say, hey, here's my PSTN number, here's my
    IP address
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and your IPv4 is proxied over IPv6, let's say
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: (IPv6 works perfectly fine as an intranet)
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and then, when you send mail, you don't rely on
    someone else's relay
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: your mail comes from your own IPv4 address,
    which is also your identity
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and if you spam from that address...
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": b-b-but you have to sign your mail with dkim!
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it goes on a blacklist and no more mail from
    you, buddy, for the next six months
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": and dkim is hard, so you should pay
    Google/Yahoo/Microsoft/AOL to deal with it!
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so you paid $10 for your IP address and now
    it's only worth $2
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hatteb sounds like he's had to deal with this
    problem personally
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" fehs at this racketeering glob.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but in any case, restricting the ability to
    just create a new identity randomly
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": I did dkim the stupid way - turns out, nobody cares if
    you use one private key to sign all of your domains.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: is the fundamental source of all social
    behavior on the internets
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": E
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: bargh, our getopt string is approaching
    an enumeration of the alphabet
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": ven the random domains i create for random purposes.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: infinite identity spaces are inherently
    antisocial, which is why we need the facebooks of the world
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": heh, I've been making a bad assumption haven't I?
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" doesn't know. Have you?
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": urbit isn't supposed to last /forever/, is it
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is definitely supposed to last forever
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: I am tempted to build some kind of long
    options infrastructure
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: there are physics-based reasons to doubt
    it will
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: Nothing lasts forever
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: well, sure.  in that sense.
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: but Urbit will probably last for a
    while if we play our cards right
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but one day, tognex, you will be an old man
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you will still be tognex
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" thinks Urbit only needs to last as long as its
    successors.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you will have amassed great reputation through
    the wit and wisdom of tognex
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: tognex, the thing people don't talk about
    is that software systems always last longer than they are supposed to.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: on your deathbed your heirs will be gathered
    around your bedside
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and one of them will get the house
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and another one will get tognex
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": assuming I die!
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: well, hopefully not
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you could be a futurist as well
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": i mean, from a non-optimistic standpoint, i probably
    will
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": spoiler: we all die.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but if we conquer death, we'll probably also
    conquer infinite population growth
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": but hey, if i'm lucky, i won't die for a very, very
    long time
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and if not, there's always the 64-bit ships
    (yachts)
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": until nobody needs tognex anymore.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we all transcend internets and become
    telepathic, or something
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I'm not so worried about that.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: urbit is definitely designed only for the human
    race as we know it.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": for the human race and earth, that is?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and the model of real estate seems like a
    pretty stable human universal.
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham] is in the building
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: not so much earth...
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes.  you know, I grew up reading a lot of
    science fiction, but actually it's 2014 and I don't seem to have a jetpack...
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": they exist, they're just not that useful
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: real estate seems like a good metaphor
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] wouldn't mind one of those magic pills that
    would make him 15 again, though.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: I think I understand a little about deed
    transfer
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: how will leases work?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: well, it depends what the purpose of them is
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: okay that's sort of a vague question, yes.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: for quite the foreseeable future, destroyers
    will be too cheap to lease
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: if the price per destroyer is even $100, that's
    a product you buy
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that would already make me one of the richest
    men in human history
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so, at $1000, you start thinking about leasing
    and stuff
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: A better way to put it might be: I want to
    empower someone else to act on my behalf, for a specific purpose.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: at this point Urbit has a $4 trillion market
    cap
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: In the world of assware, we use OAuth for
    this.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ah, you're still in the erights.org space :-)
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" makes the ward against OAuth.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: well, that's a question I do know how to
    answer there
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: basically my feeling is that the requirements
    are still too vague
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: and in non-computer land, we have power of
    attorney, hired agents, etc
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there may very well be a use for some sort of
    agency model
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but it is difficult to generalize over
    solutions without seeing examples
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Sure.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Fair enough.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and social mechanisms for these purposes are
    often quite powerful
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a real security infrastructure is a combination
    of social and technical mechanisms
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Sure.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: for instance, if Tlon is hosting dondep-radtud
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there is no technical way to prevent Tlon from
    owning you
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Right.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but there is a very strong economic reason for
    Tlon to protect your interests rather than violating them
    ~sarlug-picwep "ikari" is in the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: of course if we get a national security letter,
    all bets are off
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" connects a logic analyser to the Tlon hardware, and
    reads out zod's keys.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Or a breakin, or a bad hire, etc etc
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but some people want to build things like
    "homomorphic encryption" to in theory solve this technical problem
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": i wonder when urbit will have programs with color
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": color is nice
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: :-)
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: sure. So I guess the thing I don't
    understand about the model is: can Tlon host one of my yachts if the destroyer
    is hosted elsewhere?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this will be done through webpages not through
    pretty terminals
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: sure, the yacht is perfectly detachable
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: OK great, that goes a long way.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: actually it is only detached at the moment,
    although the destroyer should be able to assume its identity
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" hopes the terminal does, one day, sprout xterm-256
    support.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: without actually creating the ship
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": no pretty terminals? ;_;
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] actually has never liked color in his terminals
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: maybe it's because he grew up in the 80s
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: green screen, man
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: or amber
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that was cool
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: My first computer had a color monitor...
    with a color/green/amber switch on the back.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: then in around 1992 I got this awesome
    Cornerstone 1600x1200 grayscale monitor
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which needed its own graphics card and custom
    Linux driver
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: tognex, making webpages look nice is
    actually a ton easier than making stuff in a terminal look nice. It's pretty
    crazy.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] did a little bit of work on getting X to drive
    that beast
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": my terminal is gray with white text.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is twelve tons easier.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" likes a splash of color, but not some clown-fruit
    salad...
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": so, urbit stuff will be handled through webpages?
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": tognex, vere is already a webserver.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: eventually we'll have a command prompt just
    like this but in your broswer
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: (A friend of mine wrote a non-blocking
    curses-alike in Python, so I've seen much of the elephant.)
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] remembers when curses had a really hard problem
    to solve, minimizing screen update cost
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": thought the goal was to make a complete everything,
    OS, kernel, etc
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Yeah! Emacs still has a lot of that code
    in it.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": I have _great_ nostalgia for curses-style interface.s
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes, but one thing at a time
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": but urbit is going to be based in conventional
    browsers?
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: tognex, it's not an OS in that sense at
    the moment
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: if you solve the problem of a cloud server
    first, you can eventually seep into the client
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": urbit is going to be accessible to web browsers, yes
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a cloud server can serve HTML/CSS/SVG/whatever
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: without directly mucking with the screen or
    that nonsense
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] has left the building
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": ok
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: certainly not everyone wants a CLI, especially
    when urbit starts to appeal to the less geeky
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but for now it's quite adequate
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": yeah, but I'd like a non-browser non-cl interface
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: that'd be possible as well. Simple matter
    of programming.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": i suppose that's a tough thing to do, though.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I would too - but I have my business priorities
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": Famous last words...
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the thing is that it's an enormous amount of
    work to do, and more to drive adoption
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": but if the point of urbit is to get around the need
    for use of things such as conventional internet technology, it seems a bit
    weird to have it be p iggybacking off of it
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: whereas a "personal server" just isn't that
    hard to build
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: tognex, this is how networks are built
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the way I think of it is
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": tognex, it has to subsume conventional internet from
    within.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: when people built the Internet
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there was already a network
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it was called the PSTN
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" is in the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: public switched telephone network
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: tognex, i recommend watching this video,
    it's long but really interesting: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Z685OF-PS8
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: built by smart guys at Bell Labs in the 40s
    through 60s
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": i suppose piggybacking off of things is a decent way
    to get stuff done
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": If you're ever in Seattle, there's a museum of
    telecommunications.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: provided great voice and even data circuits
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: excellent wires
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the Internet guys did not replace these wires
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: they ran packets on top of them
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but, Internet computers were totally isolated
    from PSTN protocols like SS7
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": I hear that cable modems wrap a PPP session in an MPEG
    transport stream.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] believes that.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so, tunneling the new over the old is a very
    natural way to proceed
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: if the Internet had needed new wires, we
    wouldn't have an internet
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: hatteb, I am familiar with this form of
    joke. you wait for someone to say "huh, really?" and you reply "SEE, YOU'RE NOT
    SURE"
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I could totally see wrapping a PPP session in
    an MPEG transport stream
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" is actually somewhat serious. e read too much of the
    spec a while back.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: did you know that your phone's baseband
    processor is still issuing Hayes modem commands?  ATDT and the like?
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" did!
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: well the original I heard was "the JVM
    uses parts of the Mach kernel internally"
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] remembers typing ATDT into a serial driver to
    use the modem directly
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: well that's just silly
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: sure. but still funny.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" remembers getting Ethernet drivers onto machine by
    hooking them together with phone wires...
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but PPP over MPEG is exactly the sort of thing
    that telco heads would do.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ethernet isn't as different from the phone as
    we'ld like to imagine.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] remembers thin-wire Ethernet, which was
    actually... oddly thick
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] remembers that he's paying himself a salary and
    actually tries to get some work done!
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": get a job, slacker!
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: heh, you have no idea what my wife went through
    after my savings ran out, but before I got funding...
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" returns to a private hell of an undebuggable product
    made entirely of race conditions and pain.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is going to transfer all his carriers to her,
    just to show the world who's responsible for this nonsense.
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" has left the building
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": so tasfyn, what do venture capitalists do?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: they listen to people like me and decide
    whether to give them other peoples' money.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": they get people to invest their capital in new
    ventures.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" likes using words to define themselves.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: not clear where the money comes from but it's
    generally old rich people.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: or pension funds or something.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": hey, so long as it's %green.
    ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm" is in the building
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": ah, so they try to get people to give people stuff.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so, essentially the job if you can get it, at
    least at its best, revolves around applying common sense.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: or that's the ideal anyway
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: here is a video of what it's like at its worst:
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": eh, my laptop is too crappy to support videos
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zngK13FMgXM
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that's awesome, save it for a real computer if
    you can get to one
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" often has better luck with a tool to download the media
    file, and a separate player app to actually play it. No browser involved.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] misses the spartan days of his early crappy
    computers
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee] has left the building
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee] is in the building
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: when other people had the good sh*t and I
    couldn't afford it
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there was a certain style to that
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: The general concept is that they give 10
    people a million dollars, expecting that 9 of them will fail and 1 will produce
    something that ea rns them 100 million dollars.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is the 1
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: just like in that movie with Keanu
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] actually used to look a lot like Keanu before he
    got old and pudgy
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": I heard the original script had humans as paralell
    processors in the matrix.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: I'm guessing you don't mean _Much Ado
    About Nothing_.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": It was changed to batteries because "nobody would
    understand" humans as paralell processors.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: really? that might have been more sane
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] believes it.
    ~macmud-taprut: this was slightly before recaptcha started...
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] remembers that Keanu did a Much Ado, although
    nothing beats Point Break
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" just recently saw Bill & Ted's.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": holy shit, that does make more sense
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I think I may have watched that one on acid in
    the early 90s
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Much Ado, not Bill & Ted's
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee] was going to say...
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" approaches acid cautiously. Never tried watching a
    movie on it.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Bill & Ted's would be a serious waste of good
    acid
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": Yeah, that's more of a bonghit movie.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] recommends loading up on a couple of really
    solid squares and putting this on the big screen:
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8om8-DnVTU
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it will literally destroy your soul - you'll
    feel much freer afterward
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" is currently forbidden from all grey-market chemistry,
    unfortunately.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: alas, parenting and LSD don't really mix.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": Prescription 5HT2a agonists may interact badly with
    psychonautic research.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: actually "Africa Addio" is pretty much intense
    enough without any LSD.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] believes that.
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee] has a friend who watched Jacob's Ladder
    on acid
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: although I do think I tested it at one point
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": tasfyn, when will we be able to trade cat pictures
    on urbit conveniently?
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: that's right, a friend
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: nothing beats "Das Boot," the director's cut,
    on the big screen, after two or three mushrooms
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the problem with cat pictures is that urbit
    right now is a 32-bit virtual machine
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and for various silly reasons is limited to a
    512MB address space
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and also, its network protocol gets about 20K a
    second on a good day lgian-Congo-Ruanda-Urundi/dp/B0044WPDDY
                                                                                                                                                                                     
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so cat pictures... you could do it right now.
    if they were small.  but still it's hard to encourage.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": You can send cat unicode.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": booooo
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": before urbit becomes accepted, we'll need to be able
    to send cat pictures.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that's definitely true
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but you have to remember, we're a cult
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a cult's job is to be cool
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" has accepted Urbit's nature as an evil,
    mind-controlling cult run by a charismatic psychopath.
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: not to get everyone in the world at the same
    time
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: 
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: actually we only want the cool people
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: over time they will bring their uncool friends,
    but gradually
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": if you only have the cool people, you don't get the
    support the uncool people provide
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": and adequately cool people can poke holes at cults
    too well
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: eventually if we only take the cool peoples'
    moneys, we can't possibly have a business
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": why do you think most cults don't have all the cool
    people?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: well, there is "cult" in the sense of "cult
    film"
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: of course there are cults of uncool people as
    well, but they don't go anywhere
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: as for holes, we poke them ourselves first
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the difference between Urbit and Scientology:
    Scientology can't admit it's a cult
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: also Scientology has a lot more money... and
    Tom Cruise...'
    ~rovrel-bicmyl has left the building
    ~rovrel-bicmyl is in the building
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": well then we'll just have to steal THEIR money!..
    and Tom Cruise...
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": nah, not tom cruise
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] knows that Tom Cruise has only ONE FRONT TOOTH.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": if he fell for it, we don't need tom cruise
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" likes Tom Cruise in the first Mission: Impossible film.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" also remembers the passcode to the Cray: AW96B6
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]:
    https://www.google.com/search?q=tom+cruise+holoprosencephaly
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you all can ponder that while I write some
    doc...
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee] has left the building
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: aahhhh, i don't understand finite fields
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: stupid galois
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": well, they're like infinite fields
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": but smaller
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee] is in the building
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": obviously
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: stupid djb making me learn math when i just
    wanna do some crpyto
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: the worst part is that in about an hour i'll
    wonder at how simple all this is
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: and how i could have possibly been complaining
    over something as stupid as a finite
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: field
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: If only Galois had practiced his
    marksmanship more...!
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: for now though, i suffer
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: finite fields are beautiful
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: and I bashed my head against the wall
    over them for like a week trying to figure out how they worked
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: a world in which galois and hamilton had won
    their duels would be a much more interesting place
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" remembers that a field is just a set of numbers and an
    operation...
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: well, operations
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": Whoops.
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: well, and identities
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": Right.
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: "Each finite field of size q is the splitting
    field of the polynomial x^q â x, and thus the fixed field of the Frobenius
    endomorphism which ta kes x to x^q."
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: wat
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: time to dive into the wikipedia hole
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": Wikipedia is really bad at explaining a lot of this.
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: that makes a ton of sense after you've
    spent a couple years studying abstract algebra, btw
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: iirc wolfram mathworld was a good
    resource
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: as was this:
    http://www.samiam.org/galois.html
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: i recall wikipedia being basically
    useless to me
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: fortunately i think i have to learn the same
    math for both ed25519 and aes
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham] spent the past several days trying to implement
    ed25519 without understanding the math
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham] is kicking himself for wasting several days
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": I think the gist of a lot of the math in those papers
    is "Hey mathematicians, these functions work on little-endian strings of bytes"
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" is in the building
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": "also you can productively use XOR on them"
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: i also have a hoon aes field multiply
    somewhere if that'd be useful...
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": Yuck, the Wikipedia page on finite fields is fairly
    disgusting.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": A wall of proofs has never helped anyone.
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: hobmed, yes that'd be helpful
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: i'm bogged down in recursive definitions
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" is also interested, academically of course.
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: 
    ~bilsym-bisner /
    ~hobmed-hinrym/try/2/bin/aes/hoon
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: "mur", for speakers of languages that
    fuck up ls and rs
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: thx
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: perhaps one of the key things to
    unlearn is that multiplication is not just iterated addition
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: addition, being XOR, oscillates under
    iteration
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: once you get the hang of the idea that
    you're operating on polynomials that just happen to have convenient numeric
    representations, it should all start to come together
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: are you clear on finite field addition?
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: not yet
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: the link you sent me was fairly clear, but i
    still don't understand, err, what exactly the field is
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: ok, so you're adding polynomials of
    degree n. for GF(2^8), degree 8. each polynomial has coefficients in GF(2).
    since there's only 2 of those, your result polynomial (of degree n) has each
    coefficient looking like the two inputs XORed
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" has left the building
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: only two possible things each
    coefficient can be, that is
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": hey, Steve Dee read my patch, thanks!
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: sure thing
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": uh oh
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": wossup, insane cult?
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": that 59009 was not meant to make it into the final
    commit
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" feels bad that his carrier PR did not include a useful
    patch. %self-shame.
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: oh, I see now.
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": that was just a test value, before I figured out how
    to make it a command-line arg
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": i'm about to buy >20000 dogecoin
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": to build a dogedice robot
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: fixed...
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": that's ridiculous
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": that's like less than $10
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": oh, true
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": gambling is wrong:)
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": sometimes i forget how worthless dogecoin is
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee] is working on a branch with lug_u ripped
    out of u2_host
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": it boggles my mind that these machines crap out 0.1BTC
    every week, and that's a money making proposition
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": hey that history-eating bug IS fixed.  thanks for that
    too steve!
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: word
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": :ought to pull up to the latest vere.
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: that fix has drastically improved my
    quality of life, personally
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": i used to make my sentences shorter so that I didn't
    trigger the bug
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: yeah, a desirable side effect of that
    bug
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Tmux is much happier with vere
    now
    ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: ahhhh, this page is much better
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field_arithmetic
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: it enforced short chat lines
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: (desirable? well, I liked it that
    way...)
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": "enforced" in the "press enter before it's too late"
    sense
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: heh
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" sheds 28 bytes...
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee] occasionally catches himself typing
    really fast to try to get his text in "before" the 80 character mark...
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: dogecoin is inspiring
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: speaking of mixed motor metaphors
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" 's partner's parent asked if Dogecoin was 'real.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: when people complain that it's a dumb
    joke, I point out that the global financial system is too
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": pretty much.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": What is a trillion dollars?
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": Nigeria printed trillion-dollar bills once.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: as a friend put it, 'dogecoin is the
    "ironic trucker hat worn by an actual trucker" of cryptocurrency'
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": i am not sure what that means but I think it means I
    better have some dogecoin
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: ooh, instead of the history-eating bug,
    we now have an unhistory-vomiting bug if you backspace over a long line
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: or rather if you move the cursor back
    over a long line...
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee] still calls that progress
    ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm" has left the building
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Only the first full line of text is duplicated, though
    it is duplicated for every character over which one back-cursors.
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": alright, i'm going to give vere a shot on my freebsd
    machine again
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" makes the sign of the PR in yebyen's direction
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": have a feeling here goes my website
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: huh, I only see it once
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": Segmentation fault: 11 (core dumped)
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": also took bind and node with it, but not apache
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: impressive...
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": portmaster also continued without interruption
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": i'll set up a machine that doesn't also run my website
    to reproduce this bug on it
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": Now that I have the line-eating bugfix, I find myself
    unable to fill the window. Bleah!
    ~rovrel-bicmyl  has the best hearing-about-urbit story but prefers remaining
    all mysterious.
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]:  Darn your mysterious attraction
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4" will teach you a new word if you share your story.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" prefers remaining mysterious, but will allow that e
    heard of urbit through a friend on IRC, who saw it being neglected on Hacker
    News.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": i heard about it from a friend on irc
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": who wanted to show me how loony the documentation
    was
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": and i ended up installing it, for the entertainment
    value
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee] heard about it while fucking off on
    /r/programming on break time at the monastery
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": it's a lot cooler now that you don't have to go on the
    mailing list and ask why chat is down
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": so are there any programs other than :chat
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": that are noteworthy
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": :game
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": ls and cat are pretty important
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": i was going to say game next
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": there's also pope
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": :ticket, for issueing yachts from your Destroyer.
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": hi and ye
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": there's :thumb
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": there's :type
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": :zero, to remind you of the Carrier identities.
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen" hadn't seen that one
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": there's :
    ~novrud-hanweb/try=/bin/chat
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": which takes you to the other chat room
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": and then of course there's :room, which actually
    handles the stateful chat room thing
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": are there secret conspiracies in there?
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": it do
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": hmm?
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": there be
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": "they think it don't be like it is but it do"
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": so what is the other chat room exactly
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": its just a proof of concept
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": there's only one chat, for all intents and purposes
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": because chat is written to use sein who to see what
    ship should be running the room server
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": ~doznec~
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": but there's no reason you couldn't use a different
    heuristic, or a hard-coded value
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": oh,  ok
    ~sarlug-picwep "ikari" has left the building
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": damn i was hoping for another layer of conspiracy
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": there are a few other differences to make sure you can
    use both chats without going crazy or getting confused
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": it's actually where I keep my hitler jokes since
    hitler jokes don't really fit under a banner :)
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": other than banners. i am the only blue it seems ;_;
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen" has to follow up with real hitler jokes now
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": oops i missed you sarlug-picwep

    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Do you know of the :thumb procedure, ~tognex?

    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": or you get ~ /a/
    ~tognex-labmeb/will/~2014.1.15..21.52.20..dbab
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Neighborship can be accomplished either via :hi
    ~$shipname
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": (which is done at the terminal)
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": or by sending a private :chat message, e.g. ~$shipname
    <message>
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": ah
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": neighborship is the equivalent of friending someone?
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": won't you be. my neighbor.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": No, it is impermanent.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": ah
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": It must be re-established if either party exits the
    Urbit network.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": You and are are neighbors currently.
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": you mean if your address changes?
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": i didn't think that was the case
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": No, just if you logoff
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": ah
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": when you shut down your pier.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": oh, so it's a direct connection?
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Correct
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": A direct, encrypted connection.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": I suspect the :room server to retain a copy of private
    :chat messages,
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": but :hi ~$ship_name "<message>" are secret
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": ok
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": speaking of, it's shutting down my pier time now
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Vale, dear ~satnum.

    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" is in the building
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": so what should i do with my other destroyer
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": try not to sink it
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Create a new pier, and :begin it from there.
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" has left the building
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Imbue it with a different facet of your persona.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Pick your true banner
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": or the one on which you most wish to spy.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": But I don't know what my true banner is!
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Then pick the most interesting one.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Or %white.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": %white is boring
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": But as a practical matter, the advantage of %white is to
    signal formal non-alignment.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": what would you say the most interesting one is?
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": %black has the most chatter, hands down.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": %blue's probably the least active
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": I am orthogonal to all banners; I am an
    arch-experimentalist.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": so what are you spying on?
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": To spy is nigh malicious - I surveil.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": The people behind the shadowy cult, of course.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Who watches the watchers? The meta-watchers of unlimited
    abstraction.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": ...who are you surveiling?
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": You.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": hatteb, what's the most interesting banner
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": CYG
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: 
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: heh
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": hell, what are the banners, i'm not even sure i
    understand them entirely
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": banners are defined by ++sect
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": and inspired by the Qing dynasty, or so i hear.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": They are an admission of the tribal nature of much of
    humanity, and a place to channel political expression that would otherwise
    disrupt public affairs.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": mhmm. and what do they represent?
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Broadstroke political persuasions.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" suggests tognex read the doc for :begin more carefully
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Start up your other Destroyer and compare the banner
    options.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": yeah, that's a good idea.

    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": atax1a is the lucky dog who got ~net
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": but Stephenson fans know the real Metaverse lives on the
    ~ret
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" liked it because 79 is one less than the web
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": and it's where you stick your fingers.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": also net is a jerkcity character.
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: We shall see how mine susses out
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": One less? 79=net, 80=sec, 81=mul, 82=nym, 83=tev,
    84=web.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" means the oldweb.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Ah, port.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Copy.
    ~bitmet-racteg "IMT" is in the building
    ~bitmet-racteg "IMT"  once knew a fellow who possessed a white US passport.  I
    was told this meant that he was stateless and a refugee, and had some kind of
    permanent non-citi zen residency status in the US.  The former Vietnam was his
    country, and so he was stateless.
    ~bitmet-racteg "IMT": I wonder if Curtis might not know something about this?
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Intriguing.
    ~bitmet-racteg "IMT"  resolves to get back to work.

    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Oh. and I understood yesterday why Nock is
    named Nock.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": A re-entry passport for permanent residents who cannot
    acquire a passport from their nation of origin.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Though it is now green, not white.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": What is that reason, dash?
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" has its suspicions, itself.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: It's a rewriting system based on immutable
    trees, and is thus an enemy of state.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" doesn't follow the reasoning from there to Nock.
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": I thought it was something to do with mockingbirds. :)
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: oh, in the Smullyan sense
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: look up "Our Enemy The State"
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" is thus enlightened.
    ~tognex-labmeb "Tiktalik": hungry.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: uh yeah, i haven't eaten since breakfast.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: should do something about that.

    the body politic, the only things I "need" identity authentication in meatspace
    for are 1) my Urbit carrier possibly, 2) being a guest at my friend's new

    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Do you have a second Destroyer operational?
    ~monder-navryx "LarryH": well, i'm doing the mac work on just a sub, running
    the destroyer on my linux server
    ~monder-navryx "LarryH": don't have to quit chat that way :)
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": I fear I can not recommend a remedy, but Tlon would most
    likely be interested to hear your bug report.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": I would try to reproduce the behavior though, either
    with a submarine on you linux box, or Destroyer on your mac.
    ~hidsup-donsyn "UWTB" has left the building
    ~monder-navryx "LarryH": that's my next line of approach
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Are you aware of the drydock procedure?
    ~monder-navryx "LarryH": from reading old chats, yep
    ~monder-navryx "LarryH": i've been letting my destroyer sit idle in chat via
    tmux and save off the buffer every day or so in order to keep up with the
    conversation
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": A fine idea. What happens if you try to access the
    modified directly?
    ~monder-navryx "LarryH": strangely enough, :cat shows the previous contents
    instead of the current contents
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": E.g. :
    ~monder-navryx/try=/3/bin/foo
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": No re-synchronization at all then.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Have you tried building a new pier?
    ~monder-navryx "LarryH": not yet, this just started a day or so ago
    ~monder-navryx "LarryH": was just about to build a new sub but thought i'd make
    inquiries first
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": There's also :reboot.
    ~monder-navryx "LarryH": yeah, tried that too, its like something has gotten
    really out of whack

    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: I had that problem on Arch for a

    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: so, do you have URBIT_HOME set?
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has left the building
    ~monder-navryx "LarryH": ah, it appears that i don't
    ~monder-navryx "LarryH": man, all that hair pulling and you come along with
    such a simple fix
    ~monder-navryx "LarryH": changes immediately noticed when i started vere up
    again
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: yeah, tell me about it. I was a little
    crestfallen when I figured that out on Arch after a time of excitedly digging
    into libuv's fs ev ents API.
    ~monder-navryx "LarryH": just got things re-installed on my new machine and the
    environment settings got over looked
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: *nod*
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: we could probably make a way better
    guess at URBIT_HOME than we do if it weren't set
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is in the building
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: but I'm glad that we don't, because it
    makes it really obvious that you don't have URBIT_HOME set
    ~monder-navryx "LarryH": yeah, there's always that
    ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has left the building
    ~monder-navryx "LarryH": thanks a heap for the assist, 
    ~hobmed-hinrym
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: sure thing! :)
    ~monder-navryx "LarryH": now if this baby would quit waking up i could use this
    new-found syncing ability to learn this hoon stuff
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: story of my life right there
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: i think i've figured out small parts of it
    ~monder-navryx "LarryH": ditto

    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu"  is trying to learn nock
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": When dealing with the slot operator, it is often useful
    to draw the entire binary tree, of which the list only explicitly encodes the
    outermost nodes.
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": i get how it works, i just can't work through it
    step by step
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": i tried to do /[6 [97 2] [1 42 0]] 
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": What rule then applies?
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": line 19, 6 = 3 + 3, so that's /[2 /[3 [97 2] [1 42
    0]]], right?
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": and then i do the /[3 [97 2] [1 42 0]]
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": which gives [1 42 0]
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": so that's /[2 [1 42 0]], which i can't do anything
    with
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": I think you have the groupings wrong.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": /[6 b]
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": /[2 /[3 b]]
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": /[2 /[3 [97 2] [1 42 0]]]
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": No, that's right.
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Hm
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": right, and i can't directly resolve the 2 because
    there's still the / in there
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": so i do /[3 [97 2] [1 42 0]]
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": which gives [1 42 0] by line 18
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": plug that back in and it's /[2 [1 42 0]], which
    doesn't match any of the rules but 19
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": try 19, /[2 /[a b]], where a = 1 and b = [1 42 0],
    that gives /[2 /[1 [1 42 0]]], resolve /[1 [1 42 0]] to get [1 42 0] and...
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": ...i'm back where i was with /[2 [1 42 0]]
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": [1 42 0] => [1 [42 0]]
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": /[2 [1 [42 0]]] => 1
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": ah
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": right, /[2 [1 42 0]] = /[2 [1 [42 0]]] = /[2 1 42 0]
    = /[2 1 [42 0]], they're all equivalent
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": so i have to adjust the brackets until i get the
    last one
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": well i don't have to but it's easiest for human
    pattern-matching
    ~fantyv-ralpen "jpt4": Yes, the spec tries to avoid parenthis overload by

    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Potential semistupid questions
    for my own minimal enlightenment and hopefully general meat for discussion by
    those more qualified : What type of binary tree is Nock? Is it an algebraic
    expression tree? How is it traversed? Might this be easier if I drew the tree
    and calculated manually instead of looking a t numbers until my eyes bleed?
    (Once more my lack of symbolic logic is apparent.)
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: And will the wiki including such
    things as https://github.com/urbit/urbit/wiki/Decoding-Hoon be updated in
    accordance with the la st few months of doc/etc updates?
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: hm, never heard the term "algebraic
    expression tree"
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: looking at the wikipedia page i would say
    no it isn't
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: since their example has arithmetic
    operation tokens in them
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Boolean? Or something else
    entirely?
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: it's a tree of atoms and cells
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I'm well accustomed by now to
    hearing that Urbit is "X, but not as we know it"
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Most of the time, I never knew X
    to begin with
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: it's pretty much like conses in lisp
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: conses in lisp are a pair of values, where
    values are either conses or atoms
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: same in nock, a noun is an atom (number)
    or cell containing a pair of nouns
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I basically have nothing in my
    experience or knowledge base to model any of this on, apart from reducing
    formulas long ago and fa r away in entry level algebra, which is where I hit a
    number of walls
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: So I'm mainly an observer
    tinkering at the OS level, while in my copious free time indulging myself in
    the tantalizing, frustrati ng deeper mysteries
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: right, well. this is indeed one of those
    earth-programmer concepts that urbit builds on, that doesn't have a direct
    equivalent in algebra or whatever
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I keep telling my wife to try it
    as she is reasonably well learned in math as well as having a more intuitive
    grasp of abstract/e ngineering-type thought.
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: And she loves puzzles.
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: It should be a shoe-in
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: it's _sort of_ like those algebraic
    expression trees, in that nock operations are encoded as numbers
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: but they're encoded in a different order
    from the example on wikipedia
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen" is in the building
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I can see in the abstract how a
    given integer can have a meaning as an operation
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Where I fail to make the jump is
    making the calculation - I know functional programming at the level of an Excel
    spreadsheet, to use the oft-quoted example, but it's still vague on how things
    are "done". It's like Zen programming compared to the common-sense-makes-sense
    imperative style. "Let go of comman ds, describe reality, and what you want to
    happen, will happen."
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": well there are only 10 of them to look at
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: yeah I don't have a real firm grasp on
    zeno's execution model myself
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: That does indeed simplify matters
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": one of them is increment, and it has the same
    structure as the rest
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": relative to the idea of subject and formula
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: but yeah, nock is a function that takes a
    noun and returns a new one
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": the logical operators on 8 through 14 are all "not
    cells"
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": i'm at urbit-is-easy ch2
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]  wants to write some Hoon documentation in
    the form of a historical/archeological essay
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": I thought one of these numbers meant increment but...
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": it looks like it actually means "increment nock cell"
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": *[a 4 b]
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: and "stateless" means no state is
    maintained between operations? Which is even more mysterious to me than a basic
    stack machine ( I watched a dummies-level video on that +accumulators). And I
    think I vaguely get how a monad can carry information from one operation to the
    next, without state, but...
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": where [a b] describes a cell to be nocked and
    incremented
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: well, "state" just means "something that
    affects the operation that isn't represented in its inputs"
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": to be honest I am still stuck at nock 8, out of nock
    6-10 it's the only one I understand
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": the rest I could probably get if I tried, but I've
    only "read and understood" at the same time nock 8
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": and then by extension I guess also 7
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: so nock is stateless because all the
    information that affects its operation is represented in the noun
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: I did work out what 9 is for, but he then
    explains it in chapter 4, so :)
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": I didn't work out 8, I read the explanation and
    followed it
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": well, I worked it out by readig the explanation
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Yeah, I lack ninja (or really any
    more than simpleton) skills in not just math, but symbolic logic *and* learning
    other languages in general, computer or human...any one of which I suspect
    would be a strong advantage in the whole idea of "thinking different" that has
    to be done to truly understand and exp ress oneself in a language.
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Hence why I keep pimping Urbit to
    everyone I can
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: well, hoon/nock aren't extremely
    foundationally different from other programming stuff. they just don't follow
    the fashions/conventions of the past few decades
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I figure if some non-computer
    person with one or more of the above skills figures it out, they'll at least be
    able to help me understand it at a kiddy level, which would be more than my
    current level
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": there is a really small number of programs to
    understand at this point
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I also suspect my wife might be
    that person, if only I could pry her away from Pokemon and other sinister
    competing worlds
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": it seems like there are enough to work up to
    understanding arvo
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Heh, I famously attempted
    deciphering "hello world" in Hoon
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": but having not seen anyone claim to have done that,
    other than the author
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": it remains to be seen
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: It did not go well
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": no, you need to start with nock, I'm convinced of that
    :)
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Apparently so
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": I still don't know what a core is, but I'm one step
    closer after understanding nock 8
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: We fear numbers
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Unfortunately I recognize that as
    one of my greatest flaws, for many reasons, but most importantly because "math
    is how you know you're being lied to"
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": yeah, we need math
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: well, fortunately nock and friends are
    almost entirely unrelated to math
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: you need math for crypto, certainly... :)
    but that goes on top
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: a core is basically nock's mechanism for
    self-reference
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Yeah, I still need Nock Like I'm
    Five
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: which cgy said his offspring
    might be ready to write when they're Eight
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]:  So according to the wiki page,
    which binary tree is Nock most like? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": Nock is just a function
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": It is not a tree, the nock expression is a tree where
    the root is blank until it's been evaluated
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": then when it's evaluated, you have a different tree
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": possibly just one atom
    ~roppec-sampyx "Lysergic Spooner" has left the building
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": nock is evaluated on cells
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": nock atom is an error, that's one of the first lessons
    ~roppec-sampyx "Lysergic Spooner" is in the building
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": and a cell is a binary tree with at least two atoms on
    opposite sides
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": but a cell like this... [4 [5 6]]
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": has one atom on the left and two atoms (another cell)
    on the right
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": and may or may not be valid nock
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": I suspect it's not, since I just threw it together and
    I don't know nock :)
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": at least not well enough to just "write some nock"
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Might it help at all to refresh
    my memory on how to reduce formulas in algebra?
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]:  My guess is no
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: the only way they're similar is that
    they're both doing some kind of reduction
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": nah, you're not doing any algera at all in nock
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: the actual reduction steps are different
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: if you can grasp the idea of turning "(1 +
    (3 * 2))" into "7" then that's all the algebra you need to know :)
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I can see that
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: and even that is misleading because you
    reduce arithmetic from the innermost parens first
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: whereas nock is top-down
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: "top-down" only reinforces this
    notion I have of the integers themselves arranged in a tree, and that that is
    somehow used as a tool
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a" has the same notion.
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": all of the pictures of binary trees I see on this wiki
    page are not good examples of nocks
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": because they have integers at the root of cells
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": the cell is the root of the cell
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": the integer (or its cell children) are the - and the +
    of the cell's tree, left and right
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: So is this Nock?  1 splits to 2
    3, 2 splits to 4 5, 3 splits to 6 7...and what happens when you run out of
    integers?
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": so, numbers are only leaf nodes, not internal nodes 
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: oh you're talking about addressing
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": the cell address does not have a number at it, it has
    an cell at it
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": that should be clear right
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Ugh, trying to figure out how to
    phrase next question
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: yebyen taht's not strictly accurate afaik,
    address 1 is root of the tree
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] is in the building
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": yes, and if the tree is a cell then address 1 is a
    cell, not an atom
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": if it's not a cell, then 1 is an atom and has no
    leaves
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Let's try this: If I type in
    numbers to be interpreted as Nock formulas, how does it know whether they're
    values or pointers to locations in the tree?
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": they are part of either a subject or a formula, if
    they're well formed nock
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: So I have this drawing, and it
    ends with 4 splitting into 8 and 9, at the left
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: yeah that's just addresses, they're only
    used by operator 0
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": those are the right locations for 4, 8, and 9
    ~rovrel-bicmyl is in the building
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": so if you said [a 0 9], and a was the tree you have
    drawn
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": you'd get back the value at location 9
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Okay, so: If I provide, say, five
    integers. Will they be placed respectively in the matching cells (i.e., first
    integer goes in "1", the top of the tree)? No, that can't be right, because I
    recall it was mentioned that the tree evaluates and ends with a result in the
    top (previously empty) cell. But wouldn't that be bottom-up?
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": I wasn't going to say "assuming you ran nock on [a 0
    9]" because I thought it was pedantic
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": if you have a tree, 1 is not an integer or atom
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": *if you have a cell/tree
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": this is the tree I imagine you have drawn, based just
    on what you told me
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": [[[8 9] 5] 6 7]
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": I think...
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": or [[[8 9] 5] [6 7]]
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": 1, 2, 3, and 4 being cells
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": tell me what each of those cells are...
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": starting with 4
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": [8 9]
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": since that's easy
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: ...Nope, hitting the wall again
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": well after 4, the next easiest is 2
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": [[8 9] 5]
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: English and BASIC respectively
    corrupted me too young
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": and under address 3..
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": [6 7]
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": putting it back together
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": [[[8 9] 5] [6 7]]
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": which is the same as [[[8 9] 5] 6 7]
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": I know this doesn't make any sense, sorry :)
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: That's okay
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: It should be good for someone
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Hopefully more than one someones
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": each of the atoms I put into the cell are their own
    address
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I have this recorded for
    posterity to survive the breach, and to pass on to others
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": each of the missing numbers is the address of a cell
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": (why there is no atom representing that address,
    because a cell is at that location)
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": it should be obvious that there's not much sense
    putting the address of the atom into the atom itself
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": since the atom can only store one value
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Okay, those last two lines almost
    made sense, kind of
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": there might be some case where you want an atom to
    tell you its own location, but I can't imagine it now
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": good!
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: the binary tree structure in nock isn't as
    complicated as it looks
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i think of it as having layers
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: like pascal's triangle
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: so layer 1 is 1
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: then 2:    2    3
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: then 3   4  5  6  7
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: then 4: 8 9 etc. etc.
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: That's what I got
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I'm just hazy on how you figure
    out what to plug in where - I think, more so than the next step of evaluating
    the resulting expressin
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: now imagine each layer as a depth
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: in your nock expression
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: e.g. let's take the atom 5
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: it has no depth
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: the cell [5 6] has a depth of 1
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: woah
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: sorry, internet cut out momentarily
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: so as i was saying
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: an atom has depth 0
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: a cell has depth 1
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: a nested cell like [5 [6 7]] has a depth of 2
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: (And a cell is always a pair?)
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: a doubly nested cell has a depth of 3 e.g. [5 [6
    [14 15]]
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: yes
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": always
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: a cell is always a pair of nouns
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: but each element of that pair can be either an
    atom or another cell 
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Okay, I think I just saw how the
    first three lines of the spec give the ability to recursively define/declare
    things. Possibly.
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: so the addressing structure is a little like a
    lookup table
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: you find the depth of the element you want and
    then count over
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: so let's say i have the noun [[4 5] [6 [14 15]]]
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: which conveniently has all its values set to its
    / addresses
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: to find the address for 4 i would notice that
    four is in my tree at a depth of 2
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: (i.e. its in a cell that's within a cell)
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: so i count down two layers in my tree
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]:         1
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]:     2       3
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]:   4   5    6  7
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and then i count across
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: so 4 is 4
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: 5 is 5
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: 6 is 6
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and 7 is [14 15]
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: but there's a simple rule that means i really
    don't have to keep this table memorized
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: which is that whenever you replace an atom with
    a cell
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: so lets say i replace 4 with [8 9]
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: the address of the head of that cell is twice
    the address of the cell itself (or the atom that you replaced)
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and the tail just has the address of the head
    plus one
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: the head of any node n in your tree is always at
    2n
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and the tail is always 2n+1
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Heh, at "simple rule" I was going
    "Wait, no! That *was* simple..."
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Nope, that lost me again
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: But carry on, this is fascinating
    ~dilnem-nodfun "cmm" is in the building
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": so you can see as you travel down the left side of the
    tree
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: well think about it as pushing deeper into the
    tree
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": the leftmost address is always 2^depth
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": 1 2 4 ...
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": holds for the top address too, which is 2^0=1
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: tomsyt, i have some arvo questions when
    y'all are done here :)
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: k, my arvo knowledge is nicht sehr gut
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: At your leisure, I need to start
    getting ready to head out to lunch
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i'll conclude with this then
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: mainly curious about paths at the moment,
    what do cy and cx signify?
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: you start out with a noun, let's say its [[[8 9]
    [10 11]] [6 [14 15]]]
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: that's at layer 0
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and at /1
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: you push deeper
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: you can go into either the head or the tail
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: if you pick the head you get [[8 9] [10 11]]
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and now you're at /2
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: which is twice where you were before
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: now you're at /2, you can go into the head or
    the tail
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: let's say tail
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: which is [10 11]
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: or /5
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: which is two times /2 + 1
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: or 2n+1
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: basically, the 2n, 2n+1 rule is just like a game
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: where you start at /1 and navigate to whatever
    part of the tree you're looking for
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Precisely why I think my wife
    will figure it out quickly
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": that's just addressing though :)
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": .^(%cx path)  appears to get the contens of a file as
    an atom.
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": there are 10 more things to get and only five of them
    are obvious
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": %cy is something i'm not sure of yet.
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: where does %cy appear again?
    ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: As I said, I think that's where
    the majority of my issue lies, but we'll see. Thank you all kindly, and I'll
    see you later this evening.
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen": cheers!
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i think that just might be the path iirc
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and %cx is the data at the path
    ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] has left the building
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Huh. Not sure what that means exactly.
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: hang on, let me play with it
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: ok hoon question then
    ~hatteb-mitlyd "atax1a": cy appears in ls and batz and in hume.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: yes.
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: I'm looking at ++roil
    ~satnum-maptux "yebyen" has left the building
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: .^(%cy /
    ~tomsyt-balsen
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: whoops
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: yes, meaning of .^ was my next question.
    :)
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen" is in the building
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: yes, %cx is the gigantic atom at the path
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and %cy is the path itself
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: okay. that conveys some kind of meaning to
    this code :)
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: .^ is the "grab data from the sky" operator
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: ok. so that takes an access mode (%cy or
    %cx) and a path and gives you some data
    ~novrud-hanweb "yebyen" has left the building
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: %cy gives you the path itself, and %cx
    gives you the data it refers to?
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: %cx definitely gives you the data
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i'm less confident about %cy
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: right. the obvious follow up is what's
    'hard' do
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: it's listed in hoon.hoon under 'almost
    macros'
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: which makes me nervous
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: ++  hard?
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: it resists analysis with :type etc
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: hmmm, what does $+ do...
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: haven't a clue, it's not in ++  twig
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: which means it's a tile
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and i have to confess that i still do not
    understand tiles
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: curtis just put up chapter 9 though
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]:
    http://www.urbit.org/2013/11/18/urbit-is-easy-ch9.html
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: well i should say: asking :type about what
    (hard ...) produces gives me a core wrapped around my entire shell state
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: which covers this very topic
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: which makes me want to say "monadic
    something something"
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: yes i did read that, it helped :)
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: please, we only use gonads out here
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: i did notice that's not in the docs
    anymore...
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: saner heads may or may not have prevailed
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: it doesn't help that I read a bunch of
    stuff from a few naming revisions ago
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: when twigs were genes etc =/
    ~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: sane is relative, of course
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: yeah gen164 is a different beast from 191
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: okay more generic question then
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: given a core, what's the nice way to see
    the names of its arms
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: uhhh, +>?
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Hm.
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i mean, you should be able to navigate around
    any noun with hep lus and gal gar
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: which mean the same thing in this context
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: - and < both mean head
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and + and > both mean tail
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: the overloading is for legibility
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: so you have to say e.g.
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: ->+>
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: not -++-
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]  tries to fit an 
    ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: or actually no that would be -+++
    ~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: digging around in cores from the shell is
    tricky, because half the time you hang the interpreter, the other half you get
    giant walls of Nock

    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": the 2n / 2n + 1 explanation and the pascal's
    triangle-like explanation work well for explaining the structure
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": but as for actually parsing the things...
    ~dolrux-nomlup "nydwracu": when they're written out in one dimension...
