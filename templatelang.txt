Hoon's template language

Sail models:
++tuna is an xml template tree, with leaves %a %b %c %d containg twigs and
    being plain text, an empty tag, and a staitic or dynamic list respectively;
    Full node %e being an element, containing a twig and a list of tuna
    Empty node %f containing just a list of tuna
Structure of ++sail:
  ape:sail is the apex, converting a tuna(half-parsed tree of xml) to a twig
  Approximately, it cooks amp with sag for actual conversion
    sag:sail recursively constructs a %':*' list of twigs from a tuna list 'lut'
      Null-terminated
      Elements depend on the stem of the head of 'lut'
       plaintext %a is %':/'ed (string interpolation, wrap in [%$ [%$ . ~] ~])
       tag %b is passed through verbatim
       list %c is generated XX
       
    amp:sail opens with a sem, and continues with bam if we're in tall form,
    otherwise with bat
     bam:sail parses a tall tuna, from several alternatives:
       any number of ace followed by a puv cooked by rab, is a %f tuna list
        puv:sail is a list of beets, from any number of:
          bas-escaped pair of hex digits or any of -+*%;\{"
          any of -+*% followed by a sump({}-wrapped wide hoon), stagged as
          %a(text) %b(tag) %c(list) %d(dynamic list) respectively
          ';' followed by a tall-form pub:sail, stagged %e(element)
          any printable byte except '"' if in wide form and {}\ regardless
          a sump stagged to %a(text)
        rab:sail converts beets to tunas, by concatenating characters  XX
       a hag(script or style) followed by a nal is an %e element 
       a hul(tall-form preface) is also an %e element
         hul:sail is a hog(tag head), a hoy(attributes), and then a nol(tail)
       a nul('"'-wrapped interploated text), producing %f equivalently to 
         sections prefixed by space(see above)
       a '='-prefixed nol, stagged to %f
       any of -+*% followed by whitespace and a tall-form twig, getting stagged
         %a %b %c %d
       the empty string, producing a node with an %a leaf containing newline
       
      bat:sail parses a wide tuna XX
  hog:sail is a tag head, fancy term? XX
  hoy:sail is an attribute list, in %'%=' format XX
  nol:sail is a list of tuna XX
