#Tiles â€” 

Tiles, as defined in `++tile`, are AST subtrees that can be statically reduced into twigs. For a more thorough overview of how tiles work, see the Hoon tutorial, [chapter 5](/doc/hoon/tut/5/).

The formal definitions for `++tile` runes are somewhat spread out in `hoon.hoon`, so we will define them all here by stepping through `++tile`. A good way to get a sense of the common usage of `++tile`s is to look at how default samples are constructed in the arms of `hoon.hoon`.

###Summary

    ++  tile  $&  [p=tile q=tile]                           ::  ordered pair
              $%  [%axil p=base]                            ::  base type
                  [%bark p=term q=tile]                     ::  name
                  [%bush p=tile q=tile]                     ::  pair/tag
                  [%fern p=[i=tile t=(list tile)]]          ::  plain selection
                  [%herb p=twig]                            ::  function
                  [%kelp p=[i=line t=(list line)]]          ::  tag selection
                  [%leaf p=term q=@]                        ::  constant atom
                  [%reed p=tile q=tile]                     ::  atom/cell
                  [%weed p=twig]                            ::  example
              ==  

<h3 id="%axil">%axil</h3>
    [%axil p=base]                            ::  base type
A simple built-in mechanism for a few basic icons: 

+ An atom of any odor, [`@odor`](/doc/hoon/lan/odor/) such as `@ud` or just `@` for the
odorless base atom.
+ A noun, `*`.
+ A cell of nouns, `^`.
+ A loobean, `?`
+ Null, `~`. 

See also: [`++base`](/doc/hoon/lib/#++base).

####Examples
    ~talsur-todres/try=> =b |=(a=@ a)
    ~talsur-todres/try=> (b 2)
    2
    ~talsur-todres/try=> =b |=(a=? a)
    ~talsur-todres/try=> (b 2)
    ! type-fail
    ! exit
    ~talsur-todres/try=> (b %.y)
    %.y

<h3 id="%bark">%bark, $=</h3>
    [%bark p=term q=tile]                     ::  name
Wrap a name round a tile. For example, `a=*` parses as `[%bark %a %noun]`.

This is a case where the tile syntax matches the twig syntax, but only in the irregular form.  The twig equivalent of `%bark` is `^=` (`kettis`, `%ktts`), but the tile is `$=` (`buctis`):

    $=  a
    *

See also: [$=](/doc/hoon/lan/rune/#bcts) in the rune index.

####Examples
    ~talsur-todres/try=> =b |=($=(a *) a)
    ~talsur-todres/try=> (b 'try')
    7.959.156
    ~talsur-todres/try=> `*`'try'
    7.959.156

<h3 id="%bush">%bush, $&</h3>
    [%bush p=tile q=tile]                     ::  pair/tag
A tile in which there are two kinds of nouns: cells whose head is a cell (tile `p`) and cells whose head is an atom (tile `q`).  Its default value is the value of `q`.

See also: [$&](/doc/hoon/lan/rune/#bcpm) in the rune index.

####Examples
`++tile` itself is a `%bush`. As is `++twig` and `++nock`.  The rune is [`$&`](/doc/hoon/lan/rune/#bcpm). See `++tile` above - `p` is `[p=tile q=tile]`, `q` is the `$%`. There is no irregular form.

<h3 id="%fern">%fern, $?</h3>
    [%fern p=[i=tile t=(list tile)]]          ::  plain selection
A non-empty list of cases; its icon is naturally a `%fork`. The default value of a `%fern` is the first case. The programmer is responsible for ensuring that the cases are actually orthogonal (unlike with the structured forks, `%bush`, `%kelp` and `%reed`).  A good general practice is to use ferns only with leaves.

See also: [$?](/doc/hoon/lan/rune/#bcwt) in the rune index.

####Examples
A `%fern` that could be `%foo` or `%bar` has the irregular form `?(%foo %bar)`, or the regular form

    $?  %foo
        %bar
    ==

<h3 id="%herb">%herb</h3>
    [%herb p=twig]                            ::  function
A tile that's just a gate, accepting a sample of `*` and normalizing as you choose. If you use a twig as a tile, it's treated as an herb.

####Examples
When we use a gate like [`++base`](/doc/hoon/lib/#++base), as defined above in `%axil`, we are using `%herb`. Remember that when we use a tile as a twig, we get the clam, ie, the normalizing gate. `base` is just an arm which produces a gate.  Nothing has any idea that this gate is built from a tile of its own.

So when we parse `[p=base q=base]` as a tile, the parser builds the noun:

    [[%bark %p %herb %cnzy %base] [%bark %q %herb %cnzy %base]]

In other words, `base` in `p=base` is actually a *twig*, but this twig happens to produce a normalizing gate generated by clamming a tile.

The important thing to remember about `%herb` is that the actual twig we provide will be applied when we whip or clam.

<h3 id="%kelp">%kelp, $%</h3>
    [%kelp p=[i=line t=(list line)]]          ::  tag selection
The discriminated union.

See also: [$%](/doc/hoon/lan/rune/#bccn) in the rune index.

In Hoon, the head (which must be a `leaf`) is called the `stem`. The tail (which can be anything) is the `bulb`.  Cases of a kelp are known inevitably as `fronds`.  

###Examples


<h3 id="%leaf">%leaf</h3>
    [%leaf p=term q=@]                        ::  constant atom
A `%leaf` is an atomic constant of value `q` and odor `p`.
Obviously its icon is a `%cube`.

The syntax for a leaf is the same as the twig syntax, except that
`%` is never required to generate a cube.  For instance, as a
twig, `7` has a type of [%atom %ud]; `%7` has a type of 
`[%cube 7 [%atom %ud]]`.  But the icon of the leaf `7` is,
again, `[%cube 7 [%atom %ud]]`.

<h3 id="%reed">%reed, $|</h3>
    [%reed p=tile q=tile]                     ::  atom/cell
A `%reed` is a tile whose icon contains two kinds of nouns: atoms
of tile `p` and cells of tile `q`.

There is no irregular form of `%reed`.  The regular form is:

    $|  ~
        [@ @]
    ==

or in wide mode, of course, `$|(~ [@ @])`.

See also: [$|](/doc/hoon/lan/rune/#bcbr) in the rune index.

<h3 id="%weed">%weed</h3>
    [%weed p=twig]                            ::  example
`%weed` is the lamest kind of tile - tile by example.  A `%weed`
is defined by its example twig `p`, which produces the icon.

See also: [$__](/doc/hoon/lan/rune/#bccb) in the rune index.

One limitation is obvious - it is essentially useless to whip or
clam for a `%weed`.  Whipping or clamming on a `%weed` simply
ignores the sample and reproduces the example - as does bunting,
of course.  However, `%weed` remains quite useful.

The irregular syntax for a `%weed` is a `_` prefix - for example,
to use a twig `foo` as a `%weed`, we write `_foo`.  The regular
form is `$_` (`buccab`):

    $_  foo


##Reducitons

<h3 id="bunt">Bunt $_ $*</h3>
Bunting a tile - if `sec` is a tile, `~(bunt al sec)` produces its bunt - makes a twig that creates a blank default example of the tile's icon. 

See also: [%bctr](/doc/hoon/lan/rune/#bctr) in the runes index.

####Examples
    ~barred-tidset/try=> =b |=(a=1 a)
    ~barred-tidset/try=> (b)
    %1
    ~barred-tidset/try=> _b
    %1
    ~barred-tidset/try=> _@
    0

<h3 id="clam">Clam $,</h3>
The `clam` reduction generates a gate which accepts an arbitrary
noun and produces a member of the tile's icon.  Ie, `clam`
generates a validator function for the icon. 

See also: [%bccm](/doc/hoon/lan/rune/#bccm) in the runes index.

####Examples
    ~barred-tidset/try=> =a ,@
    ~barred-tidset/try=> (a 'a')
    97
    ~barred-tidset/try=> =b ,@ta
    ~barred-tidset/try=> (b 97)
    ~.a

<h3 id="whip">Whip $@</h3>
`whip` normalizes any leg `p` to any tile `q`. 

####Examples

<h3 id="fish">Fish ?=</h3>
The `fish` reduction lets us test if a noun matches the tile.
