## About the Hoon Language

Hoon is ruthlessly utilitarian, which means it's difficult to separate in to rigid categories for documentation. You'll notice that there is some overlap between twigs, tiles and types that are confusing at first. We have done our best to point out these points of potential initial confusion. The usefulness of these overlaps should become clear as you become a better hoon programmer.
