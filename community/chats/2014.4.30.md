:chat was run a bit like an engineering meeting: an overview of what everyone is working on. `~tasfyn-partyf` is in the midst of a significant retooling of %batz, `~mirdyr-nislux` is working on merges and updates in %clay, `~hobmed-hinrim` is reinventing markdown and `midlys-rocpet` has been connecting to OAuth endpoints at Facebook and Dropbox. Plenty of other discussion follows.
