    <span class="post-date">15 Jan 2014</span>

    <p>The quoted material comes from an email sent by Curtis Yarvin-- my reply is in-line.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The general idea of Urbit has always been to use the potential value of the
namespace to drive its development.  Partly this involves doing what we&#39;ve
done, which is to create a company and get funding from evil VCs.  But
fundamentally, Urbit remains an open-source project - for example, there is
no secret codebase - and we can&#39;t really succeed without public
contributions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Urbit is a labor of love, and I&#39;d like to see it go far. Cosmic, even.
I doubt anyone will begrudge you for acting within the guidelines of
today&#39;s Corporations-Are-People mindset, especially since the entire
operation has been transparent since the beginning.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Basically, as in all open-source projects, people have contributed and will
contribute to Urbit, because Urbit is cool and fun.  If they are in a sense
being paid, or expected to be paid, for this work, Urbit becomes less cool
and fun.  So we don&#39;t want to see the real estate as in any sense a bounty,
a payment, a prize, etc, etc.  A crucial element of the scheme is that
those who win, win without any prior expectation of winning.  This
preserves the fun factor.  I hope.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fun, for me, is in helping to create a virtual world, from scratch,
using no more than some simple mechanical rules. Urbit is fun, and I&#39;m
pleased by how well my contributions have been accepted.  This is
already rewarding, though, of course, I&#39;m not saying &#39;no&#39; to a carrier.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Owning an Urbit carrier is more than just a reward - it is also a duty.
 Urbit is a digital republic, and as a carrier owner you are literally a
senator of this republic.  For the moment, of course, the republic is tiny
and it does not need republican government - it needs a dictator.  As it
grows and succeeds, its governance must and will become not only
republican, but even democratic.  I hope this doesn&#39;t shock anyone.</p>

<p>It seems clear that those who accept this duty (you can always decline)
should be defined by one word: virtue.  A virtuous republic is impossible
without virtuous governors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One time, I was talking about Urbit, and someone summarized it as &quot;It
sounds like you&#39;re kind of important in this imaginary world.&quot;  I
shouldn&#39;t let this talk get to my head, but it gets difficult when you
send out messages about how important my participation can be. ;)  Now I
get to talk about being a Rear Admiral in the Urbit Republic, or
something along those lines.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Therefore, I&#39;ve decided to issue urbit.org carriers in the following way:
distribution is in rounds, each of which is defined by a previously
unannounced virtue.  For instance, in 2010, I committed to issuing carriers
to anyone who could write decrement in Nock.  I promised a prize to be
disclosed later.  I don&#39;t think anyone had any idea that this prize would
be something you could sell (please don&#39;t, though!) for over $10,000.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;You can&#39;t even buy these for dollars,&quot; Y.T. says, of her skateboard.
I&#39;m humbled by this reward, and to sell it would be completely contrary
to the virtue expected of us.  `@udd`10.000 is certainly a number, but
its type isn&#39;t compatible with ++zeno.</p>

<p>All this is to say that I&#39;ll take this duty seriously.  Sinking a
carrier makes a large portion of the address space go dark, a
complication we can all do without.  Urbit is easy, uncomplicated, and
fun, but fun can&#39;t exist without some serious work behind it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What was the virtue of the 2010 winners?  One of the classic virtues -
luck.  They did the right thing in the right place at the right time.
 Hence, in the carrier database their carriers are listed as &quot;per fortuna.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It still surprises me that Nock, as we know it, has been around this
long.  We live in a culture where something from 3 months ago is
considered old news, which makes the `fortuna&#39; carrier-holders ancient...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this round we&#39;re celebrating a different virtue - loyalty to Urbit.
 Your carrier is &quot;per fidelis.&quot;  This reflects the fact that for the last
three months, more or less, you have showed up, chatted, evangelized, sent
bug reports, worked through the doc, etc, etc, etc.  Without any
expectation of being rewarded for this, obviously.  It is the lack of
expectation that makes the reward genuinely effective, and not
overjustified.  I hope.</p>

<p>The experience of poking around in this digital labyrinth is utterly
addictive.  Even without the potential for reward, Urbit would hold my
attention, so the reward is indeed effective.  (I hope.)</p>

<p>Unless you are a present carrier holder, feel free to look through ++zeno
and pick any carrier that is presently assigned to me or to Tlon, other
than ~zod of course.  We&#39;ll adjust the bindings as needed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I like the idea of holding carrier ~net, `@p`79. The associations for
that number are mostly favorable, and I won&#39;t belabor the point by
listing them all out.</p>

<p>As a final note. I recognize that having a carrier means giving up most
of the privacy I sought in the atax1a mask, but that privacy was
illusory (and orthogonal to Urbit) anyway.  This is the price of living
in our modern world.</p>

        Continuity Breach
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">06 Jan 2014</span>

    <p>A continuity breach occurs when the entire Urbit network gets recreated- this will not happen in real life! All ships and piers prior to the breach will no longer work with the new network.</p>

<p>What does this mean for the Urbit user? If your ships have spontaneously stopped working and you built your ships and piers before the date in the lower left-hand corner of this site, (the Urbit date format is ~year.month.day), run the following commands from your urbit directory:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>git pull origin master</code> to get the up to date source</li>
<li><code>make clean; make</code> to build</li>
<li><code>rm -rf $URBIT_HOME/*-*</code> to wipe your old ships. Be sure to save any important files.</li>
<li><code>rm -rf $mypier</code> to wipe your piers, replace <code>$mypier</code> with whatever your pier names are.</li>
<li><code>vere -c $mypier</code> to build a new pier</li>
<li><code>:begin</code> and relaunch your destroyers</li>
<li><code>:chat to chat</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Email <code>urbit@urbit.org</code> if you have any questions or would like assistance. </p>

        Urbit Is &#58; Chapter 0
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">13 Dec 2013</span>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Greetings from the off-world colonies! I&#39;m your guide and scribe,
<code>atax1a</code>, a character from a book that hasn&#39;t been written yet. Every
great book has a Chapter 0, though, and you are reading mine.</p>

<p>I am often asked...</p>

<h1>What Is Urbit?</h1>

<p>Urbit could be a way of sharing your data in a way that makes it live
forever.  Maybe it&#39;s a Facebook of memories, 140 Twitters of words, or
an Instagram for when you&#39;re a grandpa. Maybe you send Urbit an email.
You can hit it with your web browser right now, but that&#39;s a bit rough
around the edges. (Given time, it could even be that BBS or MUD that
you wanted, but could never have...) It could be anything --- right
now, we use it as a glorified chat program, but one that never loses
messages. Well, almost never.  Sometimes we have to reboot the
Universe, and everything we haven&#39;t backed up is lost.</p>

<p>You may be getting the idea that Urbit is hard to define precisely. It is,
because it isn&#39;t finished yet. In reality, Urbit is just a labyrinth
of code, written as a book, running on a virtual machine (possibly
running on another virtual machine, and so on), built out of physical
parts, and it&#39;s read and written )and edited( by human mammals on a
planet called Earth. (The Urbit computer follows a &quot;Hears, knows,
does&quot; model, which I can explain later.) A lot of Earthlings call it
an art project, which isn&#39;t far off. Sometime it&#39;s Dada, other times
it&#39;s baroque, but it always has a precise scientific backing in the
form of <em>Nock</em>, which are the fundamental axioms (rules) of the
Urbiverse. Nock is all numbers, tho, and it&#39;s tiring.</p>

<p>Urbit is also a programming language. We call that <em>Hoon</em>, for reasons
I&#39;m still not quite clear on. It takes Nock&#39;s numbers and puts symbols
on them. They&#39;re kinda weird symbols, and most &quot;real&quot; programmers I
know (and work with) take one look at something like</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">|=(x=@ ?:((lth x 2) 1 (add $(x (dec x)) $(x (sub x 2)))))
</code></pre></div>
<p>and go pale around the gills. Myself, I grew up speaking a language
called <code>perl</code>, which has an even bigger love-affair with special
characters, so reading this doesn&#39;t faze me (Hoon uses its special
characters judiciously, so please don&#39;t think of <code>perl</code> unless you like
that sort of thing).</p>

<p>An earlier version of Urbit (when Hoon was still called Watt) was
rejected from a real scientific conference because the judges felt
vaguely insulted by the nonstandard language. The Urbit you&#39;re looking
at now has had a few years to cool down and mature, and right now it&#39;s
so cool at the core that it&#39;s well below -400 Fahrenheit. Thankfully,
there is an entire planet built up around its icy core, and on the
surface of that planet, it&#39;s a balmy 25 degrees Celsius, and the water
is like glass.</p>

<p>Urbit is currently only usable by a hyperliterate set of people ---
it&#39;s immersed in the culture of the word, and it&#39;s struggling for a
glimpse of air, the sound of music, and a taste of freedom.  Really,
though, it&#39;s easy to teach yourself, if you work through it with a
dedicated mind. Having a friend along for the ride is definitely
recommended. People with prior programming experience are welcome, but
be warned: your existing biases and expectations are wrong. We&#39;ll try
and be gentle about breaking them.</p>

<h1>Why should I care? (the buried lede)</h1>

<p>In the end, Urbit is a single global computer. Think &quot;Cyberspace&quot; from
<em>Neuromancer</em>, or &quot;The Metaverse&quot; from <em>Snow Crash</em>. If you&#39;re really
early, think of Haflinger&#39;s worm from <em>The Shockwave Rider</em>. But don&#39;t
think of it as the Internet --- the internet is a single global
<em>network</em>, and it only follows two rules: you can act like a UNIX
machine when prompted, and you speak TCP/IP. Anyone can see what
you&#39;re saying, and most people can understand it. There are gaps in
the network, too: <em>The Great Firewall Of China</em>, anyone? &quot;Encryption&quot;,
or as I might call it, <em>privacy</em>, is an afterthought, and people who
Never Say Anything can read a lot of supposedly &quot;private&quot; things, just
by doing the right math. <em>Urbit isn&#39;t like that</em>. It enables secure,
private, computing, in a way that nobody else can, because it is
&quot;semantically isolated&quot; --- the meaning of the Urbit program is
independent of the outside world (in this case, the Internet).</p>

<p>Urbit works like an Internet should. If you know someone&#39;s address,
you can send them a message. It will either reliably be delivered, or
get rejected. Likewise with requesting something: if you ask for
tomorrow&#39;s newspaper headline <em>today</em>, Urbit will gladly give it to
you...  tomorrow. Your ship just waits for it to come in, and when it
does, everything proceeds like normal. &quot;HTTP 404 Not Found&quot;? What the
<code>!^&amp;#</code> does THAT mean?</p>

<h2>Who ARE you people?</h2>

<p>We&#39;re dreamers, but the dream escaped and is slowly consuming the real
world. We&#39;re programmers with a sense of humor and an overload of
whimsy. At the end of the day, though, we&#39;re just people just like
you. People who want to change the world.  Everyone wants to change
the world, right?</p>

<h2>And what is with all of the weird words?</h2>

<p>Urbit is a piece of technology. Unfortunately, technology is hard to
explain, and it gets harder when the words we use to explain it are
misunderstood.  If you&#39;re used to speaking about your computers in
terms of a Unix (or Windows) workstation, it&#39;s a bit of a leap to
think in terms of Urbit ships in a pier.</p>

<p>In short, we use weird words to force a change in how our technology
is perceived. Without that, readers are likely to gloss over important
details, thinking that they understand more than they really do. It&#39;s
why we redefine everything, change the pronunciation of the symbols
you&#39;re used to, and even have our own number system. Count with me,
and feel free to scribble in the margins:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">~zod 0   (also &#39;yes&#39;)                 if i were rewriting this
~nec 1   (no)                            i would put &#39;can&#39; b4
~bud 2   [the rest of the numberz        &#39;change meaning…&#39;
~wes 3        change meaning
~sev 4    according to context]
~per 5   ---
~sut 6   &lt;but that&#39;s 0kay&gt;
~let 7   
~ful 8   
~pen 9   ¡you can figure it out!
</code></pre></div>
<p>Saying them out loud helps. You and your friend can agree on the
pronunciation.</p>

<h1>Introductions</h1>

<p>You can get in touch with me on Urbit, of course. Join up to <code>:chat</code>
and use <code>=</code> to see who&#39;s in the room. On the old internet, I go by
many names, but on this one I try to stick with <code>~hatteb-mitlyd</code>.</p>

        Hi Zod! or basic Urbit tunneling
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">08 Oct 2013</span>

    <p>One bug, or really minor misfeature, in Urbit&#39;s networking - not the evil :update bug, possibly aka &quot;ok/not responding,&quot; which remains my main quarry today, but one I had to investigate on the way to it - is that it&#39;s all very well and good to punch a NAT hole, but a lot of routers - for I guess understandable reasons - like to heal the hole up relatively quickly.  As in, a minute or two.</p>

<p>Naturally this means you&#39;re (a) totally disconnected from the Internets and Urbit too, (b) when you return, it will be with a different 48-bit address, and (c) returning means you need to re-establish your hierarchical route.</p>

<p>There are two ways a ship talks to another ship.  Actually, there are three.  In A, my ship knows your ship&#39;s 48-bit UDP address (ie, IPv4+port).  (Like everywhere on the internets, IPv6 is perfectly supported in theory.)  In B, my ship <em>thinks it might</em> know your ship&#39;s address.  In C, it knows it doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>In C, it forwards through the hierarchy, which for now at present every destroyer is ~doznec through ~zod.  In A, it sends a direct packet.  In B - the state I enter when I&#39;ve received a <em>forwarded</em> packet from you, not knowing whether I can send back through the hole - because it is not a tunnel from you to me, but from you to the first ship, probably ~doznec, on the hierarchical path from you to me - it sends <em>both</em>.  </p>

<p>As long as one party in the conversation can have its tunnels forwarded (&quot;full cone NAT&quot;), we can converge on a direct conversation with both ships in state C (&quot;STUN&quot;).  Otherwise, we end up with the dramatically inferior perma-forwarded TURN.  Earlier in the summer it was the major cause of Urbit flakage, but NAT traversal seems to work okay now.</p>

<p>With one exception.  If I forward to ~doznec, how does the packet then get to you?  ~doznec needs a valid 48-bit UDP address for you, which was the address you used to talk to it.  (The #1 newbie Unix network programming question: what system call do I use to get my own IP address()?  There are a lot of ways to do it, all bad.  The answer is that you shouldn&#39;t depend on your own IP address - and to the world, your address is where they see your packets coming from.)</p>

<p>Some of us are old and some of us who are old worked with old people when we were young.  I remember in the early &#39;90s, when I was working on interactive TV, this incredibly ancient person was in the office for some reason - probably looking for the Medicare clinic - and he explained that he&#39;d worked on Telex.  Not everyone in the room knew what Telex was, so he explained it.  &quot;Telex,&quot; he said, &quot;was the information superhighway when it was paved with gravel.&quot;  </p>

<p>Well, there&#39;s certainly <em>some</em> asphalt on the Internets, but... in a network paved with gravel, there is no way to keep your hole up but continuous active pinging.  As a result, on a bad network your connectivity can only be restored by a trivial communication up the hierarchy - ie, :hi ~zod.  The reason this isn&#39;t done automatically is just that functionality of this type is currently in the process of migrating out of the kernel into userspace.  So, while Urbit remains in the NICU... doing it manually never ever hurts.</p>

<p>Also, I welcome peoples&#39; opinions on the right <em>period</em> for this keepalive.   Is 2 min short enough?  Ya think?  I am anything but an expert here...</p>

        Urbit, from the NICU to ops Week
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">06 Oct 2013</span>

    <p>(TLDR: to keep using Urbit, delete all your pre-10/6 data, git
pull the source again, make clean, make, and start over.  Your
destroyers and tickets will keep working.  No, this will not keep
happening, though it may happen once or twice again.)</p>

<p>Urbit has been in the wild for almost two weeks now.  Which is
crazy.  Also, 11.000 people have (according to Vimeo) watched our
10-minute screencast of a command-line session.  Apparently in a
world of suck, there is a lot of pent-up demand for !suck.</p>

<p>What sucks is that we can&#39;t really satisfy this demand right now.
Because Urbit still sucks.  It was born prematurely and is doing
all it can to keep breathing. </p>

<p>At least we&#39;ve finished the major revision control update that
was in the works.  Now if your friend <code>~tomsyt-balsen</code> else has a
desk (ie, branch) <code>funky</code> you want to use, you can</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">~tasfyn-partyv/try=&gt; :clone /~tomsyt-balsen/funky
</code></pre></div>
<p>and <code>funky</code> will be on <code>~tasfyn-partyv</code> promptly.  To update,
just use the same command again.  It can even merge a bit.  Also, </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">~tasfyn-partyv/try=&gt; :update
</code></pre></div>
<p>will update the core files you got when your ship was born.  And
finally, if the Arvo sources change, you can reload everything
very simply with </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">~tasfyn-partyv/try=&gt; :reset
</code></pre></div>
<p>This will replace all the Arvo code, including Hoon in Hoon
itself, and keep your data intact - even running processes.  We
told you there was a use for Nock.  For a simpler change in a
single vane (kernel module), eg <code>%clay</code> (revision control), just</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">~tasfyn-partyv/try=&gt; :reload %clay
</code></pre></div>
<p>Bear in mind that for updates in the standard library (<code>%zuse</code>)
to propagate to the shell (<code>%batz</code>), you need to reload first
<code>%zuse</code>, then <code>%batz</code>.</p>

<p>But - isn&#39;t all this rather premature?  Yes, it is!  The point of
this update was not that anyone needs real revision control in
Urbit yet, except of course for Urbit itself.  The point is that
we need to stabilize our data structures, because Urbit needs to
get to continuity.</p>

<p>What is continuity, exactly?  It&#39;s a problem that emerges in a
network of single-level stores.  No one has built such a network
before, to my knowledge, so we&#39;re making it up as we go along.</p>

<p>In a normal 20th-century OS, there is a hierarchy of ephemeral
and persistent data that corresponds to the memory hierarchy on a
normal computer.  People sometimes talk about DRAM replacements
that are naturally persistent, but even if DRAM was persistent,
a computer running Unix would still need to be rebooted.  In
Unix, a TCP socket is ephemeral relative to a process, and a
process is ephemeral relative to the filesystem.</p>

<p>In Arvo there is no ephemeral state anywhere.  All state is
consistent and indefinitely preserved.  This works great when it
works perfectly, but it also removes a source of resilience.
Essentially the Urbit approach is to operate with high precision
and low tolerance, like an American aerospace design.  The Unix
approach has a more... Soviet... quality.  Truly excellent in its
own way - don&#39;t get me wrong.</p>

<p>So, for example, every network connection needs to maintain
message sequence numbers on both sides.  On Unix, these are bound
to your TCP socket, which is doubly ephemeral.  In Urbit, they
are bound to your public key (certificate iteration).  If your
ship loses continuity, it needs to generate a new key.  This
should not happen often - in a healthy ecosystem, never.  We know
how to compute reliably in the cloud - when was the last time,
say, a Google app lost your data?</p>

<p>Moreover, unlike in Unix, all our data is structured and typed.
When we change the type of state, whether at the kernel or user
level, we have to write a type adaptor.  We can.  So the only
excuse for ephemerality is that the underlying computer can fail,
which is what redundancy is for.</p>

<p>But, with an immature system, it&#39;s often a lot easier just to
throw away your whole state and reboot the universe.  So... we&#39;ve
been doing that.</p>

<p>Which we hope to change this week.  If you&#39;re using Urbit this
week, it&#39;s Ops Week.  We&#39;ll be trying to keep the server up and
usable for the most trivial task of a social network, chat.  </p>

<p>But, since Urbit is still in the NICU, join us on IRC at #urbit
on freenode.  Starting Monday morning, it&#39;ll be a big nonstop
party with occasional disasters.</p>

<p>And finally... anyone operating the submarines prefixed</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">~fotdug-milred
~ritheb-latlen
~hidnyr-rivrun
~binnep-lagser
</code></pre></div>
<p>you&#39;re sending us packets in the old protocol.  Please follow
these instructions at the top, so we can delete you from our
crude manual packet blacklist!  Because when we break the world,
we really break it...</p>

    <span class="post-date">25 Sep 2013</span>

    <p>Thought we&#39;d share the following email that we sent out on the developers
mailing list (urbit-dev@googlegroups.org):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Welcome to Urbit! You&#39;ve been added to this mailing list because you all are
now proud owners of one or more destroyers (let us know if you&#39;re not and
we&#39;ll remedy that). We&#39;ll be using this list to update all of you with the
latest news from the offworld colonies. Presently your subscription settings
are at one digest email daily (we have a powerful hatred of listserv-spam).
Feel free to change these settings on Google Groups to whatever you like.</p>

<p>Our target date for network continuity is Friday October 4th. At which point
the data structures we create will (if we succeed) live forever. We&#39;ll almost
certainly do at least one reboot sometime before then, so you&#39;ll have to
recreate your destroyers from your keys when we do.</p>

<p>Also, we plan on putting up some actual Hoon doc by then, so you all can, you
know, actually learn Hoon.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll leave you with some Borges: &quot;Stranger and more pure than any hron is, at
times, the ur: the object produced through suggestion, educed by hope.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since this blog post is not limited to 1000 words (seriously Google) and
because I love that quote so damn much, I&#39;ll post the whole thing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In the most ancient regions of Tlön, the duplication of lost objects is not
infrequent. Two persons look for a pencil; the first finds it and says nothing;
the second finds a second pencil, no less real, but closer to his expectations.
These secondary objects are called hronir and are, though awkward in form,
somewhat longer. Until recently, the hronir were the accidental products of
distraction and forgetfulness. It seems unbelievable that their methodical
production dates back scarcely a hundred years, but this is what the Eleventh
Volume tells us.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>The methodical fabrication of hronir (says the Eleventh Volume) has performed
prodigious services for archaeologists.  It has made possible the interrogation
and even the modification of the past, which is now no less plastic and docile
than the future. Curiously, the hronir of second and third degree - the hronir
derived from another hron, those derived from the hron of a hron - exaggerate
the aberrations of the initial one; those of fifth degree are almost uniform;
those of ninth degree become confused with those of the second; in those of the
eleventh there is a purity of line not found in the original. The process is
cyclical: the hron of the twelfth degree begins to fall off in quality.
Stranger and more pure than any hron is, at times, the ur: the object produced
through suggestion, educed by hope.&quot;</p>

        Welcome to Urbit
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">24 Sep 2013</span>

    <p>But wait - what the hell is Urbit?</p>

<p>One of Urbit&#39;s problems is that we don&#39;t exactly have a word for
what Urbit is.  If there is such a word, it somehow means both
&quot;operating system&quot; and &quot;network protocol,&quot; while somehow also
implying &quot;functional&quot; and &quot;deterministic.&quot;  </p>

<p>Not only is there no such word, it&#39;s not even clear there
<em>should</em> be one.  And if there was, could we even hear it?
As Wittgenstein said: if a lion could talk, we would not
understand him.  But heck, let&#39;s try anyway.</p>

<p>As a network protocol, we could call Urbit a &quot;seven-layer
protocol&quot; - that is, a protocol that specifies the complete
semantics of the general-purpose computer that processes it.  As
any decent IETF ninja will tell you, this is a very bad idea for
all sorts of extremely obvious reasons.</p>

<p>And from the OS perspective, Urbit is yet another slice of
userspace crap with the temerity to call itself an &quot;operating
system.&quot; Urbit is not actually an OS in the bare-metal sense.
It&#39;s a VM that runs on Linux or OS X.  Someday it might be so
daring as to descend to Xen.  Urbit has no interest at all in
drivers, peripherals, etc.  It is just a UDP transceiver in the
cloud.  Worst of all - Urbit is not even preemptive.  A poser!
(Actually all the real work, as in node, is done by libuv.)</p>

<p>Moreover, this VM is formally isolated from your actual OS.  And
everything that uses it.  Nothing in Urbit can request system
services or call existing libraries.  So Urbit is not only badly
designed and fraudulently hyped.  It&#39;s also profoundly useless.</p>

<p>Well... your browser has been reasonably successful with this
restriction.  But your browser was never designed to be any kind
of OS.  To the extent that it&#39;s sort of become an OS, it is
specialized for the very undemanding job of being a client.  A
general-purpose client, which is neat.  But not a general-purpose
server - which is a much harder problem.</p>

<p>A general-purpose server is a slab of code that feels totally
confident when faced with the problem of storing <em>all your
personal and/or corporate data</em>, across <em>arbitrary functional
upgrades</em>, for <em>all time forever</em>, while efficiently executing
and managing <em>any useful program or programs, transient or
persistent</em>.  Yeah, that&#39;s a server OS.</p>

<p>So, conventionally, this industrial strength slab of code is
written with conventional OS techniques involving (a) bare metal
and (b) like, semaphores and shit.  The kernel alone is like 12
million lines of code.  Not that a browser is any much smaller.</p>

<p>And so, 20th-century network computing is the world&#39;s most
beautiful wire, between two dumpsters of shit spaghetti.  Two
<em>completely different</em> dumpsters.  It turns out that with a big
enough dumpster of shit spaghetti, you can feed the world.  And
why not two?  Incompatibility creates jobs, you know.</p>

<p>Oh, and you can have a client without an identity.  But you can&#39;t
have a <em>server</em> without an identity.  So Urbit has to solve <em>that</em>
problem.  Unless it&#39;s just going to be a Web server.  (Urbit is
actually a perfectly decent Web server.)  Unless it has an actual
identity model, your general-purpose server - presumably a
<em>network</em> server - has no network effect.  No identity, no
network.  No network, who the hell cares?</p>

<p>And unlike your ordinary, common or garden Web application
server, Urbit does need that network effect.  You see, it&#39;s not
even our own work.  It&#39;s something we found.  On an unmarked USB
stick by the side of the road three kilometers from Area 51.  </p>

<p>We think it&#39;s probably still human engineering.  First of all,
there are no aliens.  Second, Urbit uses Unicode.  Do the aliens
have Unicode?  Or SHA-256?  <em>Where did Unicode come from,
anyway?</em>  And at the I/O level, we see UDP, HTTP, etc.  The
command line does Emacs keys.  At the very least, someone on
Earth (or at least <em>from</em> Earth) has done some porting.</p>

<p>But other than these cosmetic details, there&#39;s not much sign of a
connection to ordinary Earth computing.  For instance, Urbit
isn&#39;t written in any of our Earth languages.  It is written in
something called Hoon, which is a strict, higher-order, typed
functional language - but has nothing in else in common with 
other Earth languages, functional or not.  Hoon does not even 
use standard PL theory.  And its syntax is just as alien, although 
at least it confines itself to the ASCII plane.  (And you
probably thought the &quot;A&quot; in &quot;ASCII&quot; stood for &quot;American.&quot;)</p>

<p>Worse yet, Hoon is not written in anything normal.  It&#39;s written
in Hoon.  To be precise - the Hoon compiler compiles itself to a
much simpler automaton, Nock.  Besides machine language itself,
and its various bytecode homages, there are three simple formal
models of computing - Turing machines, lambda calculus, and Chuck
Moore.  There is also a fourth which no one has ever found useful
for anything: combinators.  Nock is a combinator automaton.</p>

<p>While nowhere near the simplest such automaton known, and
certainly not of any <em>theoretical</em> interest, Nock is so stupid
that if you gzip the spec, it&#39;s only 374 bytes.  Nock&#39;s only
arithmetic operation is increment.  So decrement is an <code>O(n)</code>,
operation; add is <code>O(m*n)</code>... </p>

<p>Clearly not a practical system.  Even if this... <em>thing</em>... that
sits on top of it was in any way, shape or form remotely sane.</p>

<p>So why not try it?  Heck, why not at least check it out?  Strange
and foolish dreamers may hie themselves to teh github:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/urbit">https://github.com/urbit</a></p>

<p>Various people have built and run Urbit on Ubuntu, Homebrew and
MacPorts.  It&#39;s possible that all these people were stone cold
ninjas.  Urbit is a pretty cool toy, I think, if you&#39;re a ninja.
Unfortunately it is not really ready for ordinary rice farmers.
If you can&#39;t resolve build dependencies by hand, we&#39;re sorry.
Urbit is probably not yet ready for you.</p>

<p>Where should you run Urbit?  Ideally, in the cloud.  Urbit can
punch a decent NAT hole.  It doesn&#39;t like to, though - what does?
Bear in mind that your Urbit instance is a single-level store -
your state is saved as a log and a checkpoint (as in Redis -
except that Redis is both fast and reliable).  This will work
much better on server hardware.  That said, there are plenty of
good reasons to keep your servers in the closet with the plants.</p>

<p>Next, you need a ticket.  Or not.  You at least need to decide
whether you want a ticket or not.  Actually, the answer is
simple.  You do want one.  But you don&#39;t need one - not yet.</p>

<p>Because Urbit, the OS, never depends on Earth semantics, it needs
its own network protocol - Ames.  Ames is a P2P protocol with its
own public-key infrastructure.  (Ames is encrypted, but the
current cryptosuite, suite A, is worthless snakeoil.  Don&#39;t trust
it with your Trader Joe receipts.)  Ames runs over UDP, and pays
as little attention to IP routing as possible.  Needless to say,
Urbit does not use the DNS at all.</p>

<p>To sling packets on Ames, you need an identity.  Needless to say,
there are a lot of ways to do distributed cryptographic identity,
all of them bad.</p>

<p>The general reason all PKIs suck is called &quot;Zooko&#39;s Triangle.&quot;
Your identities can be distributed, secure, or human-meaningful -
pick any two.  There is no way to solve Zooko&#39;s Triangle.  The
only way to attack it is to compromise on at least one vertex.</p>

<p>To see how Urbit works, let&#39;s start with a standard solution.  An
Urbit identity is called a &quot;ship.&quot;  You can launch your own ship
by generating a 2048-bit RSA key and hashing it to a 128-bit
fingerprint, which is your identity.  This trivial design is the
basis of all distributed, secure PKIs.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, an identity should be above all a <em>name</em>.  A
128-bit fingerprint looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">    316.931.986.049.624.498.975.974.005.376.666.572.699
</code></pre></div>
<p>which isn&#39;t a name.  For no better reason than the fact that,
unless you&#39;re an autistic savant, you are basically a monkey with
an overgrown monkey brain.  A name is something that fits in a 
register.  Your monkey brain doesn&#39;t have 128-bit registers.</p>

<p>Suppose we could use 64-bit fingerprints?  At first this seems
even less promising.  First of all, your monkey brain doesn&#39;t
have 64-bit registers, either.  Second, at 64 bits, collisions
are already a real problem.</p>

<p>But we can solve both these problems.  Your monkey brain doesn&#39;t
have 64-bit registers.  But anything that lets us do 64-bit
identities might stretch down to 32 bits.  And at 64 or 32 bits,
we can&#39;t assign identities by random hash.  So we&#39;ll have to find
another way of distributing them.</p>

<p>A 32-bit identity - or even a 16-bit identity - will still never
be human-meaningful.  Perhaps we can make it human-memorable.
Meaningful addresses are a nice feature in a social network, but
memorable addresses are essential.  And if we have memorable
addresses, perhaps we can build meaningful names on top.</p>

<p>The classic example of a memorable address is a street address.
Your street address identifies you precisely, using a name.  You
have this great brain hardware for remembering names.  But what
does the name of your street <em>mean</em>?  Nothing at all, usually.
And even if it does mean something, by accident or design, that
meaning has nothing at all to do with you.  (One of us grew up in
Columbia, Maryland, which has street names like &quot;Greek Boy
Place.&quot;)</p>

<p>So all we need is a simple, tasteful, memorable way to remember
32 bits - and we&#39;re on our way to approximating the Triangle.</p>

<p>Decimal notation is the worst way of remembering a 32-bit number.
IP notation is a little better.  Urbit has a typically crude
approach: we map every byte to a CVC phoneme, making names like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">   ~tasfyn-partyv
   ~sivbud-barnel
   ~tomsyt-balsen
</code></pre></div>
<p>These strings, while quite meaningless, are no less memorable
than real human names in many a language.  Moreover, they form a
language of their own, and become more memorable as you use them.
And there are 4 billion of them, which (as we&#39;ll see) is almost
exactly the right number.</p>

<p>But how do we distribute them?  One obvious solution is a proof
of work scheme, as in Bitcoin.  Coordinating a global
proof-of-work scheme is quite nontrivial, however.  Also, there
is a second reason to compromise 100% decentralization: packet
routing.  It might be possible to use a blockchain as a global
routing table.  It would take some thinking about.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there&#39;s a clue here that the Bitcoin approach just
isn&#39;t getting.  The limited subspace of short names, within the
general space of 128-bit names, is essentially <em>real estate</em>.
There is absolutely no reason, moral or practical, to give this
real estate away for free to people whose only contribution is
generating CO2 on their GPUs.  Mining is not in any way a
productive activity.</p>

<p>Rather, initially, this real estate belongs to Urbit itself.  If
Urbit has value, its real estate has value.  If Urbit has no
value, its so-called real estate is a bunch of worthless bits.
Therefore, any value in the real estate can, should, and will be
used to bootstrap the system from an economic perspective.  Ie,
it belongs to and will be captured by Urbit&#39;s developers and/or
early adopters.  If you find this morally wrong, sorry.  You&#39;re
probably some kind of a communist.</p>

<p>But because Urbit is a free republican society - not (ahem) a
fascist corporate dictatorship like Google, Facebook or Twitter -
a crucial aspect of launching or transferring a ship is that the
decision is irreversible.  </p>

<p>As the master of an Urbit ship, your informal title is
cryptographic and <em>allodial</em> - no one, not the government and
certainly not us, can challenge it.  Unless the attacker can
steal your secrets.  In which case, of course, she might as well
be you.  That&#39;s like Bitcoin too.</p>

<p>If Bitcoin is money, Urbit is land.  (Floating land is still
land, if there&#39;s a limited amount of it.)  You own both in the
same way, by proving you can keep a secret.  A Bitcoin is not
useful for anything, except selling to a greater fool.  (We&#39;re
just kidding - we&#39;re huge Bitcoin fans.)  But an Urbit ship is
directly useful, so long as Urbit itself is useful.</p>

<p>You fill your Bitcoin wallet either by creating new coins, or
buying old ones from Satoshi and his cronies.  You build your
Urbit fleet by buying ships from us and our cronies.  (Don&#39;t ask
what we had to do to get them from the aliens.  Those aliens are
into a lot of strange shit, man.)  Ships are transferable, but
Urbit is not designed to be a digital currency.  Transaction
overhead is artificially high.  Again, as in real estate.</p>

<p>Urbit at present is empty and worthless.  So 32-bit ships -
destroyers - are $0.  Launch a 128-bit ship (a submarine) and
ask me, ~tasfyn-partyv, for one.  We&#39;ll send you one, two, or a
dozen.  You can be as anonymous as you want, if you&#39;re polite.
But, if the network lives, a destroyer price will develop.  It
will be very low at first, but not zero.  Urbit is designed to be
free as in speech.  It&#39;s not designed to be free as in beer.</p>

<p>How, cryptographically, are cloud ships distributed?  And how are
packets routed?  The answer is the same - the prefix hierarchy.</p>

<p>In Urbit&#39;s naval terminology, ships above 64 bits are 
&quot;submarines.&quot;  64-bit ships are &quot;yachts.&quot; 32-bit, &quot;destroyers.&quot;
16-bit, &quot;cruisers.&quot;  8-bit, &quot;carriers.&quot;  This also resembles a
feudal hierarchy, so it comes with a feudal terminology.  There
are 256 imperial carriers, 65.280 royal cruisers, 4.294.901.760
rebel destroyers, uncounted scads of private yachts, and more or
less infinitely many rogue submarines.</p>

<p>Every ship but a submarine has a &quot;will,&quot; or certificate chain - a
linked list of &quot;deeds.&quot;  The first deed in this list is signed by
the ship&#39;s hierarchical prefix, or &quot;flagship.&quot;  Mere submarine are
independent; carriers create cruisers; cruisers create
destroyers; destroyers create yachts.  </p>

<p>A submarine is the fingerprint of its own public key; a carrier&#39;s
fingerprint is predefined in the kernel.  Anyone can create any
number of 128-bit submarines, whose free and independent
society the 64-bit naval hierarchy cannot interfere with.  And
of course, since Urbit is (a) in the public domain and (b) not
patented, anyone can fork Urbit and change the carrier
fingerprints.  Anyone can also create his own independent and
incompatible DNS, but efforts in this direction have not been
crowned with great success.  In general, the easier it is
technically to fork open-source code or an open standard, the
less likely a fork is to actually happen.</p>

<p>An independent ship is an independent reputation.  Your flagship
hierarchy, though it created your ship, has no control over it -
so your reputations are and should be separate.  But there are
not 2^64 independent reputations in Urbit, only 2^32.  Cruisers
have no control over the destroyers they create, but yachts have
no independence from the destroyers that created them.</p>

<p>The reason for this is simple - a destroyer corresponds not to a
person, but  to any institution with its own independent
reputation.  Yachts are for users, bots, or other sub-identities
of this institution.  Each destroyer has 2^32 of them, which is,
of course, a lot.</p>

<p>How does independence work in practice?  By pinning/TOFU.  For
any deed number, or &quot;life,&quot; the first instance is accepted.  Thus
when changing secrets, perhaps to transfer a ship, the donor
signs a new deed created by the recipient.  Once any ship sees
this deed, it will never accept another signed by the old owner.
Thus, a cruiser cannot sell the same new destroyer twice.
Similarly, deed 7 of ~tasfyn-partyv signs deed 8; but no ship
which has a deed 8 for ~tasfyn-partyv will either accept deed 7,
or any other purported deed 8 which deed 7 later signs.</p>

<p>Preventing a &quot;double spend&quot; thus depends on propagating the
latest deed.  For this purpose, the ocean is divided into two
kinds of ships: friends and non-friends of the ship being
transferred.  The ship has a list of its cryptographic partners,
or &quot;neighbors,&quot; for which it holds a symmetric key and a routing
(IP) address.  </p>

<p>The new owner sends the new deed to all the neighbors, thus
locking the old owner out of them.  Future new friends will get
the new owner&#39;s will the same way they get the new owner&#39;s IP
address - by a lookup through the flagship hierarchy.  Thus if we
update both neighbors and flagship, the old owner is locked out
and the new owner is locked in.</p>

<p>Technically, this is very much an imperfect procedure.  It relies
on social trust to make it effective.  For example, a malicious
seller could edit his neighbor list before delivering the ship.
You probably don&#39;t want to buy a used destroyer from someone you
distrust.  Of course, the same is true of cars.</p>

<p>And more broadly, the naval hierarchy can and should provide
general administrative support.  For one thing, the big ships
route your packets, at least when establishing contact with your
fellow destroyers.</p>

<p>So - do you want an Urbit destroyer?  You know you do.  Moreover,
they&#39;re free.  Of course, if you are satisfied with a name that
looks like</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">    ~machec-binnev-dordeb-sogduc--dosmul-sarrum-faplec-nidted
</code></pre></div>
<p>you can keep swimming around Urbit in your submarine.</p>

<p>For a while, anyway.  Because, besides memorability, there is
another reason for short names.</p>

<p>What&#39;s neat about short names is that there&#39;s a finite number of
them.  This is not a bug, but a feature.  Essentially, to borrow
the thinking of political scientist James Scott, a finite space
is <em>governable</em>.  An infinite space is ungovernable.</p>

<p>If there are an infinite number of identities, there is no way
for anyone to distinguish between a new user and a banned user.
A reputation can be punished by destroying it, but anyone can
start again at zero.  A parasite whose only reason to use the
network is to abuse it can keep coming back for more.  An email 
spammer will never run out of addresses to spam from.</p>

<p>IPv4 is a limited space, which almost but doesn&#39;t cure spam.  The
problem is that IPv4 addresses are neither personal nor property,
so there is generally no easy way to punish a spammer as he
deserves through IP blacklisting.  He is very unlikely to be in
any sense the owner of the IP address on his packets.</p>

<p>But if the email address and the IP address were the same thing,
and the present fuzzy economic relationship between the user of
an IP address were clear and simple, killing spam would become
easy.  You spam from a destroyer; you go on a list of spammers;
no one will accept your unsolicited messages, ever.</p>

<p>You can get around this.  You can buy a new destroyer.  But the
thing is - it costs you <em>money</em>.  You&#39;re not spamming for the
fun of it.  If a destroyer costs a mere $1, the spam you send
from it needs to earn you $1.  </p>

<p>This does not make it trivial for the forces of light to hunt you
down and render you into processed meat clippings.  But it sure
as heck evens the game.  Who will win?  I guess we&#39;ll see.</p>

<p>So do you want an Urbit destroyer? Read the <a href="/2013/11/18/urbit-is-easy-ch1.html">documentation</a> for instructions. Come on, they&#39;re free...</p>
