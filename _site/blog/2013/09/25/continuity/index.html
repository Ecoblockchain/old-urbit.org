  <p>Thought we&#39;d share the following email that we sent out on the developers
mailing list (urbit-dev@googlegroups.org):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Welcome to Urbit! You&#39;ve been added to this mailing list because you all are
now proud owners of one or more destroyers (let us know if you&#39;re not and
we&#39;ll remedy that). We&#39;ll be using this list to update all of you with the
latest news from the offworld colonies. Presently your subscription settings
are at one digest email daily (we have a powerful hatred of listserv-spam).
Feel free to change these settings on Google Groups to whatever you like.</p>

<p>Our target date for network continuity is Friday October 4th. At which point
the data structures we create will (if we succeed) live forever. We&#39;ll almost
certainly do at least one reboot sometime before then, so you&#39;ll have to
recreate your destroyers from your keys when we do.</p>

<p>Also, we plan on putting up some actual Hoon doc by then, so you all can, you
know, actually learn Hoon.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll leave you with some Borges: &quot;Stranger and more pure than any hron is, at
times, the ur: the object produced through suggestion, educed by hope.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since this blog post is not limited to 1000 words (seriously Google) and
because I love that quote so damn much, I&#39;ll post the whole thing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In the most ancient regions of Tl√∂n, the duplication of lost objects is not
infrequent. Two persons look for a pencil; the first finds it and says nothing;
the second finds a second pencil, no less real, but closer to his expectations.
These secondary objects are called hronir and are, though awkward in form,
somewhat longer. Until recently, the hronir were the accidental products of
distraction and forgetfulness. It seems unbelievable that their methodical
production dates back scarcely a hundred years, but this is what the Eleventh
Volume tells us.</p>

<p>[...]</p>

<p>The methodical fabrication of hronir (says the Eleventh Volume) has performed
prodigious services for archaeologists.  It has made possible the interrogation
and even the modification of the past, which is now no less plastic and docile
than the future. Curiously, the hronir of second and third degree - the hronir
derived from another hron, those derived from the hron of a hron - exaggerate
the aberrations of the initial one; those of fifth degree are almost uniform;
those of ninth degree become confused with those of the second; in those of the
eleventh there is a purity of line not found in the original. The process is
cyclical: the hron of the twelfth degree begins to fall off in quality.
Stranger and more pure than any hron is, at times, the ur: the object produced
through suggestion, educed by hope.&quot;</p>
