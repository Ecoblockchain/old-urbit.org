  <h1 class="post-title">Urbit Is &#58; Chapter 0</h1>
  <h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Greetings from the off-world colonies! I&#39;m your guide and scribe,
<code>atax1a</code>, a character from a book that hasn&#39;t been written yet. Every
great book has a Chapter 0, though, and you are reading mine.</p>

<p>I am often asked...</p>

<h1>What Is Urbit?</h1>

<p>Urbit could be a way of sharing your data in a way that makes it live
forever.  Maybe it&#39;s a Facebook of memories, 140 Twitters of words, or
an Instagram for when you&#39;re a grandpa. Maybe you send Urbit an email.
You can hit it with your web browser right now, but that&#39;s a bit rough
around the edges. (Given time, it could even be that BBS or MUD that
you wanted, but could never have...) It could be anything --- right
now, we use it as a glorified chat program, but one that never loses
messages. Well, almost never.  Sometimes we have to reboot the
Universe, and everything we haven&#39;t backed up is lost.</p>

<p>You may be getting the idea that Urbit is hard to define precisely. It is,
because it isn&#39;t finished yet. In reality, Urbit is just a labyrinth
of code, written as a book, running on a virtual machine (possibly
running on another virtual machine, and so on), built out of physical
parts, and it&#39;s read and written )and edited( by human mammals on a
planet called Earth. (The Urbit computer follows a &quot;Hears, knows,
does&quot; model, which I can explain later.) A lot of Earthlings call it
an art project, which isn&#39;t far off. Sometime it&#39;s Dada, other times
it&#39;s baroque, but it always has a precise scientific backing in the
form of <em>Nock</em>, which are the fundamental axioms (rules) of the
Urbiverse. Nock is all numbers, tho, and it&#39;s tiring.</p>

<p>Urbit is also a programming language. We call that <em>Hoon</em>, for reasons
I&#39;m still not quite clear on. It takes Nock&#39;s numbers and puts symbols
on them. They&#39;re kinda weird symbols, and most &quot;real&quot; programmers I
know (and work with) take one look at something like</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">|=(x=@ ?:((lth x 2) 1 (add $(x (dec x)) $(x (sub x 2)))))
</code></pre></div>
<p>and go pale around the gills. Myself, I grew up speaking a language
called <code>perl</code>, which has an even bigger love-affair with special
characters, so reading this doesn&#39;t faze me (Hoon uses its special
characters judiciously, so please don&#39;t think of <code>perl</code> unless you like
that sort of thing).</p>

<p>An earlier version of Urbit (when Hoon was still called Watt) was
rejected from a real scientific conference because the judges felt
vaguely insulted by the nonstandard language. The Urbit you&#39;re looking
at now has had a few years to cool down and mature, and right now it&#39;s
so cool at the core that it&#39;s well below -400 Fahrenheit. Thankfully,
there is an entire planet built up around its icy core, and on the
surface of that planet, it&#39;s a balmy 25 degrees Celsius, and the water
is like glass.</p>

<p>Urbit is currently only usable by a hyperliterate set of people ---
it&#39;s immersed in the culture of the word, and it&#39;s struggling for a
glimpse of air, the sound of music, and a taste of freedom.  Really,
though, it&#39;s easy to teach yourself, if you work through it with a
dedicated mind. Having a friend along for the ride is definitely
recommended. People with prior programming experience are welcome, but
be warned: your existing biases and expectations are wrong. We&#39;ll try
and be gentle about breaking them.</p>

<h1>Why should I care? (the buried lede)</h1>

<p>In the end, Urbit is a single global computer. Think &quot;Cyberspace&quot; from
<em>Neuromancer</em>, or &quot;The Metaverse&quot; from <em>Snow Crash</em>. If you&#39;re really
early, think of Haflinger&#39;s worm from <em>The Shockwave Rider</em>. But don&#39;t
think of it as the Internet --- the internet is a single global
<em>network</em>, and it only follows two rules: you can act like a UNIX
machine when prompted, and you speak TCP/IP. Anyone can see what
you&#39;re saying, and most people can understand it. There are gaps in
the network, too: <em>The Great Firewall Of China</em>, anyone? &quot;Encryption&quot;,
or as I might call it, <em>privacy</em>, is an afterthought, and people who
Never Say Anything can read a lot of supposedly &quot;private&quot; things, just
by doing the right math. <em>Urbit isn&#39;t like that</em>. It enables secure,
private, computing, in a way that nobody else can, because it is
&quot;semantically isolated&quot; --- the meaning of the Urbit program is
independent of the outside world (in this case, the Internet).</p>

<p>Urbit works like an Internet should. If you know someone&#39;s address,
you can send them a message. It will either reliably be delivered, or
get rejected. Likewise with requesting something: if you ask for
tomorrow&#39;s newspaper headline <em>today</em>, Urbit will gladly give it to
you...  tomorrow. Your ship just waits for it to come in, and when it
does, everything proceeds like normal. &quot;HTTP 404 Not Found&quot;? What the
<code>!^&amp;#</code> does THAT mean?</p>

<h2>Who ARE you people?</h2>

<p>We&#39;re dreamers, but the dream escaped and is slowly consuming the real
world. We&#39;re programmers with a sense of humor and an overload of
whimsy. At the end of the day, though, we&#39;re just people just like
you. People who want to change the world.  Everyone wants to change
the world, right?</p>

<h2>And what is with all of the weird words?</h2>

<p>Urbit is a piece of technology. Unfortunately, technology is hard to
explain, and it gets harder when the words we use to explain it are
misunderstood.  If you&#39;re used to speaking about your computers in
terms of a Unix (or Windows) workstation, it&#39;s a bit of a leap to
think in terms of Urbit ships in a pier.</p>

<p>In short, we use weird words to force a change in how our technology
is perceived. Without that, readers are likely to gloss over important
details, thinking that they understand more than they really do. It&#39;s
why we redefine everything, change the pronunciation of the symbols
you&#39;re used to, and even have our own number system. Count with me,
and feel free to scribble in the margins:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">~zod 0   (also &#39;yes&#39;)                 if i were rewriting this
~nec 1   (no)                            i would put &#39;can&#39; b4
~bud 2   [the rest of the numberz        &#39;change meaning…&#39;
~wes 3        change meaning
~sev 4    according to context]
~per 5   ---
~sut 6   &lt;but that&#39;s 0kay&gt;
~let 7   
~ful 8   
~pen 9   ¡you can figure it out!
</code></pre></div>
<p>Saying them out loud helps. You and your friend can agree on the
pronunciation.</p>

<h1>Introductions</h1>

<p>You can get in touch with me on Urbit, of course. Join up to <code>:chat</code>
and use <code>=</code> to see who&#39;s in the room. On the old internet, I go by
many names, but on this one I try to stick with <code>~hatteb-mitlyd</code>.</p>
