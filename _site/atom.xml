   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Urbit, &lt;code&gt;~2014.1.13&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; is bemused by the @p and @da having text-span versions.
Almost like you did that to break the runes someone came up with, and force
them to use names. :)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the reason to have them directly in the subject
is that you often want to use them in path
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: s
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: sure
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so -&amp;gt;- and -&amp;gt;+, instead of just -&amp;gt;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: one more character, you get two versions
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; nods.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and paths really do have to be text.  because,
you know, text
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: that -+&amp;lt;&amp;gt; is so great, it imitates the way my poor brain
would walk down the tree doubling and incrementing, only effortlessly
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; really likes this model of computation on a single
subject.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes, life is much better without the silly
&amp;quot;environment&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] can&amp;#39;t wait to see what happens when programmers
who grew up in hoon are introduced to 20th-century languages
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t let perl&amp;#39;s elegant syntax lead you astray: it&amp;#39;s
not as easy as it looks!&amp;quot;
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; grew up speaking Perl.
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot; too.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Hoon&amp;#39;s syntax is crystal-clear to me!
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; &amp;#39;s physical manifestation appears to have communication
problems, though.
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: try drawing a cartoon
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: I ask a coworker to test something before giving it to
the customer, and he does the opposite.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; wonders in what universe &amp;quot;Do not give this to the
customer&amp;quot; translates into &amp;quot;hand straight to the customer&amp;quot;.
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: draw a cartoon where he gives it to the customer, then a
princess appears and explodes him ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] is
in the building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Next time I&amp;#39;m in Japan, I&amp;#39;ll just give him a real-life
reenactment of some Unicode Emoji on his desk.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] resists the temptation to use unicode emoji as
hoons
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] but still wants to use them as output-only
markers
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: eg, pile of poo for your stack traces...
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: ew
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: what about CAT FACE WITH WRY SMILE
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: that would be better
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] thinks pile of poo is too new to be reliable
anyway
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; just found some buried treasure in this codebase!
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: We truncate some 64-bit values to 32-bits, and have
done so for nearly the entire lifetime of the product
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s okay if there are less than 4 billion
sered
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: served
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] always wonders whether or not to check for
32-bit reference count overflow
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: rev45000-ish has the lines introducing this issue. The
most recent rev is 1127622.  ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] has
left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] doesn&amp;#39;t know what the software is but that
sounds like a lot of revisions
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: it would be fewer revisions if anyone besides me
wanted to learn the version control software.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] imagines a future where every keystroke gets its
own change number
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; imagines a past where this software worked properly.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;this&amp;quot; being my reality, not Urbit. Urbit always works
properly, in  both the past and the future.  | ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]
imagines a past where lots of things worked properly, Detroit existed and the
army could win a war
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Urbit has always existed, I got the code in a
time machine
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: I got the code on a USB stick at DEFCON.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Which is canceled this year, by the way.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: really?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: why?
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: Defcon is cancelled?
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: The Dark Tangent retired last year. Plus, I heard they
sold out of tickets already.  ~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] can&amp;#39;t find this on his googles, perhaps he lives
in an alternate 2014
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: they must not have updated the website!
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is actually pretty confident that Urbit has made
contact with one of the other 2014s
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: either that or he&amp;#39;s being trolled...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] sighs.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is just not cool.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: sometimes, one should not trust content from
hiddem-lomder.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: or hatteb-mitlyd...
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: or rigryx-sovrus. let&amp;#39;s just get all my ships out
there.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has been too generous, frankly
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; was surprised to get 4, honestly.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has billions.  or did before he started giving
them away.  ~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; is in the building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; is ready to surrender all but one as penance for its
acts of trolling.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] just offered four carriers to probably our last
angel/seed investor, if he comes through
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: obviously the same deal is available to anyone
here if he/she has 250K under the couch
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: also ~nyt is currently going, going... at 11.7
bitcoins
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which makes your destroyers worth...
approximately... 0.001 cents each
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: of course they have much greater sentimental
value!
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has almost 1/3 the market cap of Dogecoin.~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] still wonders what the hizzy is ~balweb-sarlyt
[Mark Zavislak] has left the building ~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot; has left the
building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: http://tweetnacl.cr.yp.to/software.html - curve25519
and related functions in convenient twitterable form.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that is so djb.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] imagines a world where djb is a billionaire and
Zuckerberg asks if you want fries with that.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; wants to live in that world. Maybe it can have a BeOS
phone, too.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] used to work for the guy who wrote the BeOS
filesystem.  or one of them.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Giampolo?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Schillings.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: maybe he was the second guy on it or something.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] thinks he&amp;#39;s at Yahoo now or something.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: he was my boss at Openwave after Bruce Schwartz
left the building.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but Be was one of the last great system
software companies.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Giampaolo wrote the BeFS that replaced OFS,
apparently. I never used OFS, I think that was in the pre-R3 Be...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yeah maybe Schillings was OFS.  I don&amp;#39;t know.
I never used a Be myself... but it was cool.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; only used the x86 port.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: all that is solid melts into air.  except for
Urbit of course.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] wishes FirefoxOS wasn&amp;#39;t so lame.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; wishes the web weren&amp;#39;t so lame, and has words to say
about people&amp;#39;s lack of attention span.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] sees lame all around him, and not just on his
computer.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; believes twitter and facebook and youtube to have
reduced people&amp;#39;s attention spans to less than 5 minutes.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] doesn&amp;#39;t use either twitter or facebook, for
precisely that reason
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] shows his kids youtube sometimes and feels
guilty about it, also for that reason ~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot; is in the building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; uses twitter, but posts to it from IRC. Occasionally
has issues because even IRC&amp;#39;s buffer is larger than twitter&amp;#39;s.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] can&amp;#39;t believe there is an entire
multimillion-dollar company whose raison d&amp;#39;etre is posting to twitter as a cron
job.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: speaking of buffers...
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: and speaking of curves:
https://www.imperialviolet.org/2013/12/25/elligator.html
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: elligator, for those unfamiliar, is a scheme to ensure
that an elliptic-curve point is indistinguishable from a random string.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: this is a desirable property.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hm, that looks kind of interesting
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: burnham is more the math expert on this one...
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; is an armchair mathematician. Actually, an armchair
everything.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Years of fell and fugitive life has atrophied the
human element in me...  ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] is in the
building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] had a human element but it burned out~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] has left the building ~racbes-solmun
&amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot; has left the building ~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc] has left the
building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; pictures tasfyn as a hoon-emitting robot ~novrud-hanweb
&amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; is in the building ~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; has left the building~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: do not use teh ^W, not when you have
applications running
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: Sorry guys, nandchat is gone
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the event routing, she is not working so good
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: gone?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: dead, kaput, pushing up teh daisies?
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I managed to quit all of my apps now I get %time-lost
p=51 q=0 r=/wa
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: and %flub {}
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: can I recover from this by replaying ?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] thinks not.  ~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; is in the
building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: on the other hand, you seem to be okay, so...
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: it kind of looks like the trick to get it back was to
press ^W again
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is not responsible for the outcome of any such
tricks.
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: maybe it&amp;#39;s just the submarine that&amp;#39;s hosed
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the n-word chat does appear to be working
nromally ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham] has left the building ~midlys-rocpet
[John Burnham] has left the building ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] has left the
building ~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] gathered that.  ~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; has left
the building
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: guys the color of the stuff coming out of
my nose is starting to get close to the color of my (green) handkerchief
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: just fyi
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] caught con flu at 30c3 it seems
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] doesn&amp;#39;t know what it looks like but he knows
what it sounds like ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne] is in the
building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] hears labfes-larzod will be out in SF pretty
soon ~rovrel-bicmyl is in the building
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: yes
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] welcomes rovrel-bicmyl
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: last week of february
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: well, that&amp;#39;s soon enough I guess..
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: at the rate i expect work and
such to cause the weeks to fly by
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: god help us if we don&amp;#39;t actually have some hoon
doc by then
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ha ha, actually I&amp;#39;m just finishing up chapter 7
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: cool
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: with any luck i might
understand some hoon by then
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: by february even little girls will know hoon
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: yeah but little girls
probably don&amp;#39;t get home from work and open up beers
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] plans to teach his daughter at least one hoon
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: depends on your little girl I guess
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: mine gets home from school and opens up
pbskids.org
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I assume that because it&amp;#39;s PBS it can&amp;#39;t be
rotting her brain
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: hahaha
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i wouldn&amp;#39;t make that
assumption
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s PBS!  it&amp;#39;s educational!  haha.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: maybe not but it tranquilizes her and gets her
off my hands.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is not necessarily always the parent he ought to
be.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: it&amp;#39;s interactive, at least, i
suppose
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: indeed.  and even somewhat literate.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: make sure you have an
adblocker installed
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] &amp;#39;s daughter probably wouldn&amp;#39;t go for a
first-person shooter anyway, she&amp;#39;s pretty girly
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i&amp;#39;m pretty sure the worst
thing about watching tv was the ads
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: PBS doesn&amp;#39;t have ads, it has public service
announcements
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] isn&amp;#39;t sure there&amp;#39;s any such thing as a
public-service announcement blocker
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: or a words-from-our-sponsor blocker
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: PBS is for the chic, it even has chic ads
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: because i was a college
student and was living in a small apartment
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i never bothered to get a TV
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] takes another pull on the meth pipe and reaches
for some Cheetos
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: so every time i see ads on TV
now, i get really weirded out by them
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] grew up without a TV, he is from a chic family
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i watched plenty of tv as a
kid
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: not wealthy, but quite communist nonetheless~balweb-sarlyt [Mark Zavislak] is in the building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; gets more information out of TV when the sound is off.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: communists don&amp;#39;t believe in TV, it is one of
their many cultural superiorities
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] welcomes balweb-sarlyt.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: anyway it&amp;#39;s not just TV that
is the problem
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: it&amp;#39;s the advertising
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: because ads are actually
incomprehensible mishmashes
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s not the TV or the advertising
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s the audience...
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: well there&amp;#39;s that too
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the lesson of PBS is that advertising for chic
people can be and is chic
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: an audience that can extract
anything from those ads, an audience that is meaningfully targetted by those
ads, is in trouble
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] doesn&amp;#39;t need to see that to know that his
country is in trouble
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: he works at 10th and Mission, after all~balweb-sarlyt [Mark Zavislak] has left the building
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i guess i will see 10th and
mission soon enough
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: he could throw a stone and hit the Twitter
headquarters.  also, three pot stores.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: really
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; offended Twitter security by not having his license
name match the logbook.  \/ ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes.  there&amp;#39;s the
upscale pot store, the middle-scale pot store, and the hilariously downscale
pot store that can&amp;#39;t even get it together to hav\/ e a proper sign.  \/
\/
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: well i might have to try that
(the stone throwing part (jk))
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] suggests that he should have chilled out by
going around the corner to &amp;quot;Re-Leaf.&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: don&amp;#39;t throw stones at Twitter, I think their
security is pretty good...
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Turns out, identifying as Eugene Belford and then not
presenting an ID with that name on it, bothers some people.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i never got around to doing
that to the tumblr hq in NYC!!!
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yeah it might!
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] likes to sign in as Robert E. Lee.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: who&amp;#39;s a dead ringer for Ben Bernanke, by the
way.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i wonder how far the BV sf
outpost is from twitter hq
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: From PR Gnus in Washington,
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: BV?
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: bazaarvoice
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ah right that&amp;#39;s where you work
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: one wonders how many people think:
&amp;quot;BizarreVoice&amp;quot;... a very different kind of startup...
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: yep
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: every time
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: every single time
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] practices his bizarre voice.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that&amp;#39;s okay, I&amp;#39;m a tone-deaf founder myself
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: &amp;quot;Tlon&amp;quot; sounds like a Bond villain company name.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s even worse on our legal docs, which all
say &amp;quot;Tlon Corporation.&amp;quot;
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: how do you even pronounce it
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: T&amp;#39;lon.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: oh
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Tuh-lon.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: ohh
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i was thinking tee-lon
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: &amp;quot;Our reporters have learned that Tlon
Corporation has been secretly introducing LSD into your water supply...&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: actually we need to become a megacorporation so
we can have a security arm - Tlon Global Security.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] always trusts content from Tlon Corporation.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: heh
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: hahahha
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Tlon Heavy Industries
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Tlon Propulsion Systems
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: the always trust content
thing tho will be more literally true of BV
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; snickers.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: how so?
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: We&amp;#39;ve all seen Videodrome, yes?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is actually sadly limited in this category
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but he was thinking about always trusting
content...
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: give me a sec let me see if
there is a link
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; was going in the direction of malish company names.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]:
http://www.bazaarvoice.com/authenticity/ of course there is a link
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] used to know a tiny multimedia company called
&amp;quot;Colossal Pictures.&amp;quot;
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: hahhha
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: ... i just noticed that when
i think of the word colossal the first thing i think is &amp;quot;hard to lift&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] was actually thinking of
http://www.bazaarvoice.com/bestiality/.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: HAHAHAH
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: The head of Spectacular Optical says something like...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but #EndFakeReviews sounds a little like
#EndPoverty
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: We make inexpensive glasses for the Third World and
missile guidance systems for NATO. We also make Videodrome, Max.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: hashtags are a key component
of modern marketing campaigns
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: not because anyone actually
uses them
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: but because they suggest
hipness etc
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes.  but eventually this becomes ridiculous
and then played-out.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: anyway, everyone wants to end poverty, but it&amp;#39;s
not clear how to do it
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: true | ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis
Yarvin]: actually I have a plan but it&amp;#39;s not really a politically correct one
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and the same is true of fake reviews...  |~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Is it a modest proposal?  | ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis
Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s a rather immodest proposal.  | ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]:
really San Francisco specific.  | ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it involves
the Farallons...  | ~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Reduce the Bay Area to glass?
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: well the engineers on the
teams in question say they&amp;#39;ve got an idea | ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth
(raptros) coyne]: 
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: fake reviews are spam, so if you can end
spam...
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: 
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: I had to deal with an oldweb way of handling spam
recently.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: well there&amp;#39;s a way to end
spam if you&amp;#39;re in-control enough
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has to wash his hands every time he handles spam
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: It was unpleasant and I don&amp;#39;t think it adds any
security, just makes it harder to send email.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: but uh given the events of
today, i probably shouldn&amp;#39;t get into it too much
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: cuil theory?  Wasn&amp;#39;t that a failed startup,
Cuil?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: heh the Judge is not amused.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: cuil was hilarious. the cpedia gave me so much
amusement in those boring moments during school.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;I know! Let&amp;#39;s markov-chain a search engine AND
wikipedia!&amp;quot;
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: what was cpedia
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: basically what i just typed.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: oh
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: oh no
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: You would search for something, and get a mishmash of
Wikipedia and web content.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Not &amp;amp;ing kitting.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: kidding, either.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: dude that&amp;#39;s hilarious, I totally missed it
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this is why Urbit does not go out seeking teh
press
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: the press is a monster

~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: this one: ?:  &amp;amp; 47 52

~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: oh okay!
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: what&amp;#39;s no?  !?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: no is |
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: yes &amp;amp; 0
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: no | 1
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: believe this is actually mentioned in a
previous chapter
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that&amp;#39;s correct
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but there is a lot of very confusing material
coming quite quickly...
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: there was a promise early on that the reader is not too
stupid to learn Hoon
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: :S
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: the reader should probably start from the beginning of
the hoon part again...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the writer may be too stupid to teach it
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: thank you for the nice doc though!  once it&amp;#39;s metabolized
it&amp;#39;ll probably have been great!
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s actually a lot harder than I thought, but
yes, in the structure I wound up with
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you probably want to go through it twice
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: did 7 come out last night/this morning?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: last night eh
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but I forgot to send an email
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a 3-year-old was jumping on my head

~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: reat!
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: also I&amp;#39;m going to give the chapters actual
titles, the jokey ones are becoming lame
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: *g
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: fine line between lame and jokey eh
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: hoon bites back!

~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: hoon is adopted by a nice family
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: hoon eats their baby
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: hoon gets rabies?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: rumors that hoon has rabies are entirely false
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it may have leprosy... or elephantiasis... but
not rabies!

~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: yeah, after you implement your own nock evaluator of any
variety
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hoon just doesn&amp;#39;t add that much over nock
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: except that you can actually program in it...
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: at present, *you* can actually program in it...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes.  also a couple of other people
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but we&amp;#39;ll get there... really... we will
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: I&amp;#39;m still seeing ascii soup, but I hope it&amp;#39;ll pass
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it will pass once you start using it
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a good test is how easy it is to see syntax
errors
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: syntax errors feel physically painful and I see
them instantly
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: like a missing brace in C
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but at this point... ascii soup
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we need lots of cool fun exercises, preferably
that serve webpages
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: yup
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: btw is the http server an arvo-level thing or a
vere-level thing?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is arvo avec le collaboration of vere
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that is, vere is doing events at the http level
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: not at the tcp level, we don&amp;#39;t have a tcp level
event system yet
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] feels less uncomfortable about gating vere
directly to tcp than he used to
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: I&amp;#39;d really love to see an exposition of the vere/arvo
interface.  i.e. what&amp;#39;s the protocol for calling the operating function
(operating core?) etc
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the closest thing is ++card in zuse.hoon
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but it is poorly organized and contains both
input events and output actiojns
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: but I&amp;#39;m probably just damaged in being so interested in
that ~lapled-rammyn [Jordan Lewis] has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: also if you look at the Postface in hoon.hoon,
this is the interface of the outermost core
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: about 8 arms
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the main one is ++poke, ie, send an event and
convert it into a new state and a list of actins
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: actions, actins are proteins
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: now that&amp;#39;s some hoon-learning motivation right there
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] likes that he attracts more systems guys than
language guys
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: after all, the #1 reason why any language ever
has been adopted:
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s the default language on some OS people
wanted to use.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: C is better than Pascal but that&amp;#39;s not why it
beats Pascal...  ~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot; is in the building ~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;

~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: my second face is here ~tomsyt-balsen [John
Burnham] has left the building
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: ah, that&amp;#39;s interesting
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: apparently the submarine is completely dead
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: but the destroyer is fine
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: i can&amp;#39;t ctrl-w into the sub
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: and i only get the flubs when i&amp;#39;m running chat~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; has left the building ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] is in
the building
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: have my sub and destroyer done a vulcan
mind-meld?
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: are they now, in fact, the same ship?
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: this whole thing of having multiple ships on a
pier seems slightly suspect
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: let&amp;#39;s see if i can trigger another sequences of
flubs
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: flub?
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: oh that&amp;#39;s bizarre
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: let&amp;#39;s test from the other end
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i was in chat
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: did a ctrl-w
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: to tomsyt-balsen
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: which was odd
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: ~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i ran a second chat
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and now i&amp;#39;m chatting from the second one
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and am getting atrocious terminal lag
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and yet still urbit refuses to die
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: this aint no soviet engineering
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: let&amp;#39;s see if i can cause more mischief
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: success!
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: i got my sequence of flubs!
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: the bugs is fscking reproducible
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: let&amp;#39;s try to reproduce it again
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: am now in a second chat on the phantom tomsyt
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: which has eaten my sub
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: now i do a ctrl-d ~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; is in
the building
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i get my flubs
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and then a ctrl-w stops the flubbing
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: fascinating
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i can&amp;#39;t wait to hear cgy explain this one
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: if i had to guess, it&amp;#39;s that running a phantom
chat on the second ship
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: looks like the same process to incoming packets
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: but looks like a different process to outgoing
packets
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: so i kill the second process
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: on the phantom ship
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and i get %time-lost until i switch away
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: but the interesting thing is that i still get
filesystem events from the submarine
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: hang on, i&amp;#39;m gonna try to run a program on the
sub
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: it works!
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: my submarine is now my neighbor
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: even though i can no longer get on it
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i vaguely recall someone finding this bug at
some point in the past
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: tomsyt: i can&amp;#39;t say I&amp;#39;ve read everything you
said but that all happened to me yesterday
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: ^w made the flums go away
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: etc
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: *flubs
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and ^w sets it off
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: working on a submarine, I was trying to see
if I could get it to join :~novrud-hanweb/try=/bin/chat
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: when I tried a sub that didn&amp;#39;t have another
ship in the pier, it worked
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: that&amp;#39;s peculiar, innit?
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: all i can say for certain is that something,
somewhere is getting confused
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i&amp;#39;ll ask cgy about it
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: although he&amp;#39;ll probably see my giant wall of
text next time he&amp;#39;s on
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i&amp;#39;d apologize for spamming, but the urbiverse
has been quiet today
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: the store and forward architecture is going
to help me get over my addiction to hackernews
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: here, there is no illusion that I can or
should read everything
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: ...I read everything
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: but then again, i suppose that that&amp;#39;s my job
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: that&amp;#39;s great, I can&amp;#39;t even find time to
finish reading the hoon docs
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: I just fixed a ruby thing though
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: what sort of ruby thing?
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: there&amp;#39;s this mechanize script that worked
with mint.com up til a few days ago
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: mint-exporter
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: to log you in and download a CSV of all your
transactions
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: but what would one do with said CSV?
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: looks like they made everything very
javascripty without any user-visible difference
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: mechanize doesn&amp;#39;t work anymore
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: use it to reconcile (say) a ledger
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: it&amp;#39;s very hard to get data out of mint.com
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: are there mint competitors that let you import
csvs?
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: there&amp;#39;s no API, they don&amp;#39;t want one
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: &amp;lt;-
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: not a competitor so much as beeminder
integration
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: working on it
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: this is one of the pain points we here in the
urbiverse are trying to solve
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: all your mint data should live in your home
folder
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: or rather main/lib
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: well a ledger is one of those things that&amp;#39;s
kind of hard to do with the variability of data
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: mint does a pretty good job with showing you
the balance of cash accounts
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: but there&amp;#39;s often no transaction to show when
the balance goes down
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: I feel like I should have a page that shows
me a red light for each pending transaction that hasn&amp;#39;t been recorded yet
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: since it&amp;#39;s one of the things that each
different bank probably does differently
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: M&amp;amp;T Bank does a crappy job of delivering the
news for instance
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: I suspect
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: but anyway the mint-exporter with
capybara-webkit support is up, if I knew how to use capybara correctly it would
be awesome but it works
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]:

~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: test
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: John you fixed that nasty -- problem in markdown... nice
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: https://github.com/Katee/quietnet
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: yeah that hephep problem was annoying
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: apparently github flavoured markdown interprets
-- as a horizontal rule
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: even though the md specs say that an &amp;lt;hr&amp;gt; is
three heps
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: and even inside of a code block
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: so i had to use GHMD&amp;#39;s code block fencing syntax
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: n.b. quietnet is a chat program that uses
no sockets or bluetooth connections of any kind
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: which maruku on my laptop doesn&amp;#39;t process
properly
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: at least there was an easy workarond
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: i&amp;#39;m surprised that hoon syntax doesn&amp;#39;t cause more
problems with markdown!
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: except now i have to put changes on the web
before i can see whether they worked or not
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: but it&amp;#39;s fine
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: i&amp;#39;m just griping
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: you&amp;#39;d think that having raised $100m, GH would
have its shit together
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: does gfm use redcarpet still?~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot; is in the building
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: evening, ~racbes-solmun
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: good evening
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: tonight&amp;#39;s stupidity excuse: head cold
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] empathizes
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: that is, I am also using that as a
stupidity excuse
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: in reality, I have no more excuses
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: I have a hoon repl on a local machine
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: and three whole chapters of doc
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: but also more distractions than there were up on the
mountain
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: and a head cold.
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: why is the rum gone
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: i also have a head cold
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: which is making this process of grokking edwards
curves more annoying than it should be
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: fortunately i also have tomato soup
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] empathizes re distractions
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: turns out there&amp;#39;s a bunch of stuff going
on in the city
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: drastic difference from that one day I
kept living for most of last year!
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: hey, man you only do two days
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: the day you enter
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: and the day you leave
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] hums Cosmic Charlie
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSXm4FUmE5g
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: i love the wire
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: quite confident that people will still be
watching the wire
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: long after baltimore ceases to exist
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: which, at present trends...
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: hmm. i am receiving every chat message twice.
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: that sounds like a problem
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: that sounds like a problem
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: &amp;gt;_&amp;gt;
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: ctrl-x cycles through processes. if you
ctrl-x twice and see two &amp;#39;&amp;amp;&amp;#39;s, ctrl-d on one of them
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: if not, I defer to ~bilsym-bisner
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: aha. i think i&amp;#39;m good now.
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: Probably hit ctrl-x out of emacs reflex.
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] nods
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: I suppose one day we will have an emacs
urbit mode
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: we may also have an urbit emacs mode, but
that one frightens me ~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot; has left the building
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: gnu emacs needs to die
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: as son as possible
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: write us an editor in hoon!
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: hoon can&amp;#39;t be any more confusing and uncomfortable
than elisp
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: in my experience, it is until it isn&amp;#39;t
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: (I speak as a loyal emacs user and elisp author of
15 years)
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: of course, my experience is atypical.
most people will learn Hoon from comprehensive, friendly docs. I learned Hoon
as koan practice.  ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] is in the
building ~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot; is in the building
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: hmm. what are all these %flub %time-lost messages
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: if you scroll back up the chat log, i have
involved journey through the time-lost flubs
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: *an involved ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen)
Wolfe-Pauly] has left the building
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: basically, don&amp;#39;t hit ctrl-w
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: it causes flubs
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: but if you do get flubbed
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: ctrl-w fixes it
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: it&amp;#39;s very strange
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: of course, if you haven&amp;#39;t hit ctrl-w,
this might bear further investigation
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] approves of &amp;quot;lul&amp;quot; as an abbreviation for

~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: luslus is for teh lulz?
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: i did hit C-w
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: i guess that falls under &amp;quot;doctor doctor, it hurts
when I do this&amp;quot;
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: Anyway re broken destroyer, I did copy my passphrase
over from .urbit
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: what&amp;#39;s the deal with the entropy entered for :begin
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: if I recreate my pier and get that wrong, what would
the symptoms be?
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: you wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to create your
destroyer
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: you also wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to create your
destroyer if you got it right, at the moment...
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: ha
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: recreating destroyers within a continuity
era is coming soon
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: or rather ownership transfers
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: the flub should be salvageable, though --
have you gotten it?
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: okay. i&amp;#39;ve got a different destroyer that i haven&amp;#39;t
been able to get working recently
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: let me try ot restart it and i&amp;#39;ll pastebin the log~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short] is in the building
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: hello, is this on
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: sorta
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: huh. well that works now
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: oh. it half works.
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: it can send but not receive. curious.
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: which destroyer?
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: ~malmec-libsev ~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]
has left the building
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: aha. it can&amp;#39;t receive? that&amp;#39;s surprising.
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: yes. :hi ~zod hangs indefinitely ~malmec-libsev
[Allen (dash) Short] is in the building
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: *blink*
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: huh. chat join/leave works
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: but = doesn&amp;#39;t
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: ok i hit C-d in that one but we don&amp;#39;t get a leave
notification. wacky ~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; has left the building
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: are you still flubbing?
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: no flubs, here or there ~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash)
Short] has left the building
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: puzzling.
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: see http://bpaste.net/show/rqqwFwUJofwUssRmnIrT/
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: :update just hangs at [waiting...] until C-d
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: you have john and I flubbergasted. can
you drydock that pier and send it to curtis?
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: sure, how do I do that :)
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: tar czf mypier.tar.gz mypier
urb/$mydestroyer urb/$mysub ~/.urbit/$mypassfile
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: ah. I thought &amp;#39;drydock&amp;#39; might involve
exporting/modifying stuff :)
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: well, it does. just not in urbit. :-p
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: heh heh
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: also don&amp;#39;t run that pier after you send
it in, of course
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: i could see that causing problems yes.
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: two instances of the same pier running on
the network will do strange and terrible things ~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash)
Short] is in the building
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: couldn&amp;#39;t resist one last try before packing it off.
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;:  now :hi ~zod succeeds but still no receipt in :chat
or :update
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;  tars it up
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: I am starting to vaguely suspect that
you&amp;#39;re just dealing with some sort of network delay
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: well
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: both piers are on the same network, just different
hosts 
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: and it worked on that host a few days ago~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short] has left the building
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: hmm
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: well, in any case, send it in and we&amp;#39;ll
see what we can come up with

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]:  good morning peoples
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: hail!
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: curious to see some of these bugs reported
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I guess malmec-libsev was messing around with
^W, huh
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a rather dangerous pastime in the present state
of things...
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: too bad :chat can&amp;#39;t east the ^W since that seems to be
the only time there is an issue
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: *eat*
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that would be a very bruceacious way of fixing
it :-)
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: not a fix... just a way to get by until it gets fixed
properlty
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: i&amp;#39;ve been cured of ^W myself ~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; is in
the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but no, it gets processed by batz first and we
need it in other places
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: of course ~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; has left the building
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: hey, nobody said it was dangerous... :)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I did somewhere in a cellar with a &amp;quot;beware of
the leopard&amp;quot; sign on the door
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: ah, of course.
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: what&amp;#39;s next to get documented? web services? (hint hint)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: plenty more language doc is on the way
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: web services are great of course but some arvo
level cleanup is necessary as well
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we&amp;#39;ll probably do a simultaneous doc and
cleanup at this level
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but there are a few more chapters of language
doc ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] is in the building ~talsur-todres [Galen
(galen) Wolfe-Pauly] is in the building
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: the last one was very helpful but got a bit challenging
towards the end! e.g.
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: [%brdt *]  [%brcn (~(put by *(map term foot)) %$ [%ash
p.gen])]
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: i know... obvious to the average peasant..~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; is in the building ~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; has left the
building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes all we&amp;#39;re doing in that line is putting the
foot in the core with a name of $
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: probably should be less intimidating than it is
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: a foot of ash...  ~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; has left the
building ~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; is in the building
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: what is obvious to the average peasant is deadly to the
average pheasant
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: gosh, look at the time ~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; has left the

[Curtis Yarvin] has left the building ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is in the
building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] looks at the time
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hatteb, do you have the skinny on that slow
destroyer?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the time is ~2014.1.13..19.12.01..9ffd
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: just so ya know
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] assumes everyone is reading chapter 7 with
savage assiduous diligence
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: performance goes in and out, really. sometimes it
works great, but when it&amp;#39;s processing a large bolus of data (like :chat
backlog)
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: it goes to pot.  ~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; has left the
building ~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot; has left the building ~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;
is in the building
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: top says it&amp;#39;s in kqread state, most of the time.~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; is in the building ~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; has left the
building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] doesn&amp;#39;t know kqread state off the top of his
head.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: he does know his interpreter isn&amp;#39;t the fastest
thing in the world
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the chat backlog involves a bunch of
interpreted things - interpreted printing, interpreted network protocol...
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: kqread is in the bowels of libuv, most likely. I&amp;#39;ll
just blame interpreter inefficiency for the time being.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: also, &amp;quot;goes to pot&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#39;t mean what you think
it means, I don&amp;#39;t think
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes it&amp;#39;s almost certainly a waiting state
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: what exactly happened?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hm, doznec paused oddly for a moment
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] will blame Digital Ocean inefficiency for that
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: it pauses oddly, and consumes all of its time on a
single CPU. :) ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: when does it pause oddly?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] pauses evenly.
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: it pauses oddly, but i cannot correlate it with any
time in particular.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] finds this bug report unsatisfying.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] finds your lack of specificity disturbing.
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: it does seem to be related to the network, though. i
can get it to brifly eat a CPU by chatting, apparently.
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: Argh!
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: briefly as in 1 sec, 2 sec, 10 sec, 0.1 sec?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] remains quietly present.
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: briefly as in between 1 and 2 seconds.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: odd.  what exactly do you do to make it do it/
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: each chat, it pauses for 1-2 sec?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has some old profiling code in there which has
decayed from disuse./ ~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; is in the building
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: it does not pause for every chat.
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: it pauses for many chats, but sometimes it pauses with
the &amp;amp;... prompt.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the pause with &amp;amp;... means you&amp;#39;re waiting for~doznec
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it really shouldn&amp;#39;t pin the cpu
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: Is there anything I can do from inside Arvo to help
diagnose this?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: not really at present, because profiling is not
live
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is surprising that &amp;amp;... would pin the cpu
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: or that something that happens then would pin
the cpu
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: because literally, &amp;amp;... is just the state of
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve said something to :room but haven&amp;#39;t heard anything back yet&amp;quot;
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: what are your feelings about ktrace,
atax3a?
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: It could just be false correlation on my part.
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot; can ktrace this, sure.  ~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; is in the
building
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot; is, in fact, ktracing. As we speak. And it just paused
before the &amp;quot;as&amp;quot;.
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: oh goodie
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: peculiar indeed
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I&amp;#39;ve never seen anything like this
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] suspects that hiddem&amp;#39;s computer has gone to pot.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: an expression first recorded in 1662, I&amp;#39;ll have
you know
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: It could be my machine - this is in a jail on ZFS,
which is a nonstandard configuration squared.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if this is interacting
oddly with the checkpoint fsync
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it also could be the gc, which runs every 5
seconds whether we need it or not (we should never need it)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is still looking for that 28-byte leak, which
appeared mysteriously when satfex fixed all the other leaks
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: &amp;gt;_&amp;gt;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is sure that&amp;#39;s just a coincidence though.
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: hm. i&amp;#39;m not getting  filesync events either.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that bug sometimes pops up with non-ZFS
filesystems as well
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] does not entirely trust either libuv, or the
linux kernel, or his own code in this matter
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] can&amp;#39;t wait for a couple of interns to show up
this summer so he can send them into a greasy hole with vague instructions&amp;#39;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: like &amp;quot;go to system software hell and come back
with why I&amp;#39;m not getting my inotify events&amp;quot;
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: That&amp;#39;s not even vague.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: not as vague as it could be, but it assumes a
determination to do battle with whatever orcs may be encountered ~dilnem-nodfun
&amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; has left the building ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] is in
the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] goeth to lunch
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] has battled enough orcs that he is
starting to notice a certain orc-like structure to his reflection~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] has left the building

Wolfe-Pauly] has left the building
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: testing 1 2 3 4 3 2 1?
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: yes, hi.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: hard to decouple network latency from vere latency~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it requires better toolage than we have~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] is in the building
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: So, if I send in ktrace.out files, would anyone be
able to read them? Or should I kdump them beforehand?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I&amp;#39;m anything but an experienced ktrace user...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: really the main question is whether you&amp;#39;re
spending your time inside nock or not
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you should be able to see this relatively
easily
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we are not instrumented to add urbit traces to
the ktrace trace ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is assuming that ktrace is something like
dtrace, which can thus be instrumented ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] is in the
building
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: ktrace is more like strace - not an instrumentable
thing, just a syscall-boundary scanner.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: got it, but at least it tells you whether
you&amp;#39;re in user or kernel mode
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I assume
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: reminder, we have a chat meeting tomorrow nite
at 7pm PST
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Important Things will be discussed
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this has been your friendly local reinder
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: reminder
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: also, we have an IRL meetup next monday
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: in san francisco
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]:

~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; , astoundingly, should be able to make that, somehow.

tired of beautiful California winter weather ~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; has left the

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] just pushed an update to chapter 7
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: chapter 8 is coming sooner than you know...~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hang on, we got a page build failure
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Dr. Jekyll is Mr. Hyde all the time
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you will never ever catch me releasing a
product which tells you there&amp;#39;s a syntax error, BUT NOT WHICH LINE
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] &amp;#39;s idea of what Jekyll can do with itself are
graphic, profound and unprintable
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; once used a product whose config-parse error was &amp;quot;YOUR
JSON IS BAD AND YOU SHOULD FEEL BAD&amp;quot;.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]  has strong feelings about this whole era of
Wiffle Software
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that&amp;#39;s at least funny
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: I call it clownshoes garbage.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that&amp;#39;s good too
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Coffeescript is probably better than Jekyll but
I still feel the same way about it
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hint, if you can build Rome in a day, it&amp;#39;s
probably not a very good Rome
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] &amp;#39;s current feeling about the &amp;quot;Markdown family of
standards&amp;quot; revolves around the Todd Haynes film _Poison_
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a very arty late-80s homoerotic take on the
important sociopolitical issue of prison rap[e
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] doesn
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] doesn&amp;#39;t really see Markdown on the top in this
scene.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: tomsyt-balsen just discovered that the GFM
examples on Github&amp;#39;s own page don&amp;#39;t render properly.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the &amp;quot;M&amp;quot; in GFM stands for &amp;quot;Markdown,&amp;quot; it is
totally false that the &amp;quot;G&amp;quot; is for &amp;quot;Goats.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: actually the specific tool at fault here seems
to be something called Maruku
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which I think is an Albanian word for what you
do if you want to get married, but only have a goat.  ~rovrel-bicmyl has left
the building ~rovrel-bicmyl is in the building ~rovrel-bicmyl has left the
building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is still struggling with Markdown.  The goats
may be winning.
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: markdown is only mildly annoying
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: gh pages is a fscking nightmare
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: their parsing is sloppy as hell
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: but I&amp;#39;ve solved it, mostly
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and now i just feel dirty
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: okay, the latest and greatest chapter 7 is now
posdted
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: thanks to considerable effort from
tomsyt-balsen
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; likes the updates so far.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] prefers natural hoons to synthetic hoons.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: This seems a bit like classifying a book on Urbit into
a fiction/nonfiction axis.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ultimately it matters because the way you
really know hoon is to know ++ut, the compiler
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so the difference between synthetic/macro hoons
and ones that are implemented directly
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: is that you have to actually understand the
natural (direct) hoons, whereas you can just look the others up
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ++ut is less than 2kloc so it should be more or
less knowable...
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot; is admittedly scared of strings like
p.i.t.t.p.i.t.p.u.may
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this is what the alias feature is there to fix
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: Also, I see that fink:ut and finq:ut have the same
sigfas. intentional?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ooh, just a sec
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes, there is actually no jet for finq - it
shouldn&amp;#39;t have a sigfas at all
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: I meant to asm
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: no I meant to ask, (freudian slip there)
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: is someone a _Total Annihilation_ player
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: (&amp;quot;core&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;arm&amp;quot; were the names of the two factions
in that game.)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: heh, not at all
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a shared love for short words, I guess~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; is in the building ~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot; has left the

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: :room stays up
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: if you can fix it by cloning chat.hoon, i&amp;#39;ll read
about it later :D
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; has left the building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: from the tweeters: &amp;lt;bascule&amp;gt; [32] Raft consensus
visualized:
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: &amp;lt;http://thesecretlivesofdata.com/raft/&amp;gt;
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Thank you for that site, ~hatteb-mitlyd.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Does raft encounter many long-term race conditions in
practice? Even in the toy example of network partitioning, it seemed to take a
long time to elect a leader.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; is unsure. e&amp;#39;s only ever encountered Raft in theory.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Test
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: %tost
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: doznec is a clingy neighbor
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: even Mr. Rogers only insisted approx. daily
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot; has left the building
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot; is in the building
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: freshly :reset, no problems
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: hey tasfyn, might i get push access to the doc repo
directly? or should i just push PRs?
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: :hi ~zod

~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot; is in the building
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; is in the building
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: is :update a thing i should expect to
work? because it&amp;#39;s telling me &amp;quot;main failed to merge&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;arvo failed to merge&amp;quot;
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;:update&amp;quot; should work, but is (iirc) known to be
&amp;quot;fragile&amp;quot;.  Not sure if that helps.  CGY or John B. should be consulted.
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: okay. well if i&amp;#39;m receiving chat messages
I will take that as a sign nothing is too broken and stop worrying.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: malmec-libsev, have you manually altered any of the
files in arvo or main? That caused merge failures for me as well.
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short] has left the building
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot; has left the building
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] is in the building
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: :update should work
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: unless you&amp;#39;ve made changes to your directory
tree
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: merging still pretty much sucks
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: figure out where the merge conflicts are and
just fix it manually
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: that should probably work
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; is in the building
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short] is in the building
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot; is in the building

~lapled-rammyn [Jordan Lewis] is in the building
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: :update is indeed fragile
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it awaits an OS cleanup pass, similar to what I
just did on hoon
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but documentation is coming first
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the right way to (try to) fix your merge
problems is to git pull, then cp -r from urb/zod
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; is in the building
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: Hail hail, there&amp;#39;s a new ~novrud-hanweb/try/ desk
again, I forgot to add the &amp;#39;?&amp;#39; doc
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: excellent
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I like that people are actually using the
filesystem...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: also btw, the current auction bid is 10BTC
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that one will probably stick I suspect...
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: :ls / ~novrud-hanweb/try/
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: oops
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: 
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: /try=/ or some other version
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: I think I asked this before but don&amp;#39;t recall seeing an
answer -- is anyone running their destroyer(s) on cloud based hosts?
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: Like amazon ecc etc.?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: actually I think most people are
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: interesting
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: certainly zod and doznec are on digital ocean
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: well, I don&amp;#39;t know about most people
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: i was for a bit but without web access to chat and the
command line it doesn&amp;#39;t have much advantage i found
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: and i&amp;#39;m not running a server that anyone else is
depending on
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: Is there a &amp;quot;howto&amp;quot; for folks who wanna try but don&amp;#39;t have
the time to figure out the details?
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short] has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: to run on amazon?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the directions on urbit.org should be
sufficient if you can get an instance going
~bitmet-racteg &amp;quot;IMT&amp;quot;: yeah, it&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;getting an instance going&amp;quot; part I
specifically wanted to avoid learning too much about.  :-)
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: getting a droplet on DO is maybe a 3 step
process
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: very easy
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: aws is somewhat more complicated
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short] is in the building
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: What&amp;#39;s the min-cost of a DO instance?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: $5 a month.  We&amp;#39;re paying 10 I think
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: Interesting.  Another question: I&amp;#39;ve got a couple of
beagleboards lying around, arm processors, run ubuntu.  Any reason why urbit
will obviously fail on a arm processor?
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: Also these look interesting: http://cubox-i.com/
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Urbit should be architecture-independent. I think some
intrepid souls have gotten it running on Mandroid devices.
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: That was my belief, but I thought it possible I was
missing something.
~labtud-machep [Steven Dee] is in the building
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: I like the idea of having a continuously running
instance, and I like the idea of a portable physical instance too, although I&amp;#39;m
not sure I can justify the latter.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the difficulty with urbit on low end machines
is that if they die, your ship loses continuity
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short] has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but labtud-machep over here is working on Raft
so you can have a cluster of them
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ideally a Beowulf cluster...
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; experiences unwelcome fasdot fasbcks.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there was a time when /.  didn&amp;#39;t suck, at least
not that much
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: OK. Yeah, as long as the media is extractable from the
&amp;quot;low end instance&amp;quot; I should be able to get the instance running again, right?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: maybe, maybe not - it depends on whether you
have committed everything before computing and responding to it
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: urbit is not terribly great at this at the
moment
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but then you don&amp;#39;t have any mission-critical
data in urbit I hope :-)
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: Sure.  but that could happen on any machine, right, given
a crash.
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: Not just yet.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; keeps all of its missions in Urbit.
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: I don&amp;#39;t even have a mission, for that matter.
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; has left the building
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: But I have plans.  No one knows my plan.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Oh dang I think I have to recreate the :thumb which
read a .plan from the thumbee.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it could.  but it is more likely to because our
present prototype doesn&amp;#39;t pay much attention to ACID
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; may be able to restore it from backups...
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: I unthinkingly blew away my $URBIT_HOME. How
thoughtless of me.
~labtud-machep [Steven Dee]: yeah I have a local Beowulf cluster going on my
portable laptop thin client terminal machine
~labtud-machep [Steven Dee]: it&amp;#39;s running all of Raft except the useful part
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: Beowulf cluster under vm&amp;#39;s running on your laptop, or do
you have LFB (Little Farm of Boards) of yer own?
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: Raft, I know not.
~labtud-machep [Steven Dee]: actually not even VMs
~labtud-machep [Steven Dee]: well vere is a VM, right?
~labtud-machep [Steven Dee]: so I&amp;#39;m running a bunch of veres
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: vere is a real VM
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: as opposed to all of those fake ones that virtualize
x86_64 with hardware assistance
~labtud-machep [Steven Dee]: vere, putting the V in VM
~labtud-machep [Steven Dee]: VVM
~labtud-machep [Steven Dee]: the extra V stands for VYOVV
~bitmet-racteg &amp;quot;IMT&amp;quot;: Nice try, sonny, but it&amp;#39;s turtles all the way down.
~labtud-machep [Steven Dee]: until you get to the badgers
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: easiest way to distinguish rooms seems to be to use
tis to find residents.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: heh
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is distressed to think that all the cool kids
are over in yebyen&amp;#39;s room.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: at least he can post logs.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: i keep _almost_ forgetting that :room buffers
messages, so i can&amp;#39;t miss anything.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: unless the whole :room dies
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short] is in the building
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; is in the building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Is the w3c serious about letting the MPAA in?
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: The oldweb has this surreal parody aspect to it, more
often than not.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: why shouldn&amp;#39;t they be?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: exactly...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the oldweb was dead to me when popup blocking
in browsers just kind of stopped working.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; used to cry &amp;#39;death to the http monoculture&amp;#39;, and then
it got all Snowd&amp;#39;in.

~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: I&amp;#39;ve always been on this side of the breach...
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: updated and reset, I feel so
fresh

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] uses hand sanitizer as deodorant, it leaves him
feeling ineffably fresh
~wacdyr-ripwes is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: :ticket `@p`0xdddd.0100
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: doh
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Is C-w still flaky, tasfyn?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes :-)
~todnym-nathes has left the building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; avoids.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: who owns sarlug-picwep?  it seems to be
misbehaving...

~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; looks forward to it.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] looks sideways at it.
~wacdyr-ripwes has left the building
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short] is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: macmud added forward-word and backward-word
(M-F and M-B) to dill
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: that will help my middle-aged emacs fingers out a bit.
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: i was just missing those, myself
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] has left the building
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot; has left the building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: I&amp;#39;d read the article you linked, dash, but the URL
appears to say it all.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has left the building
~talmul-noswed has left the building
~macmud-taprut: huh, vere acts pretty funny if you switch the order of _lo_boot
and _lo_init
~macmud-taprut: (note, I don&amp;#39;t advise this)
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: funny ha-ha, or funny &amp;quot;there is a fish in my coffee&amp;quot;?
~macmud-taprut: the latter
~macmud-taprut: 2 cuil funny, you might say
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; has left the building
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: So I hear Urbit failed because
nobody has implemented strip poker in it within someone else&amp;#39;s time frame
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: where did you hear that?
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: oldwebz

~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: From the guy who&amp;#39;s partnered with
Stanislav to sell secure hardware
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Also, another writer I&amp;#39;ve never
heard of calls Urbit &amp;quot;the current epitome of the &amp;#39;toy boat startup&amp;#39;&amp;quot;
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: A definite compliment in that
context
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; had a friend lovingly say that Urbit could become the
next Smalltalk.
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: smalltalk wasn&amp;#39;t perfect but it was a
definite improvement on most of its successors
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: it&amp;#39;s a pity that the smalltalk implementation most of
us use is literally a child&amp;#39;s toy
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: made by Apple and Disney in a joint. venture.
~bitmet-racteg &amp;quot;IMT&amp;quot;: q:(slap !&amp;gt;(.) (rain ~ &amp;#39;(add 2 3)&amp;#39;))
~bitmet-racteg &amp;quot;IMT&amp;quot;: doh.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: insufficent hax
~bitmet-racteg &amp;quot;IMT&amp;quot;: No, twas not my intent to send the message &amp;quot;5&amp;quot; to

~bitmet-racteg &amp;quot;IMT&amp;quot; q:(slap !&amp;gt;(.) (rain ~ &amp;#39;(add 2 3)&amp;#39;)) 5

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I could be a toy boat startup, whee
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: everyone i know thinks Urbit is academic performance
art...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the &amp;quot;toy boat startup&amp;quot; guy is Paul Sawaya, I
think Burnham knows him
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that famo.us thing is cool too!
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] is in the building
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot; has left the building
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: hey guys, a funny thing happened on the
way to the :chat
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: when I searched for my ticket, gmail
asked me: &amp;quot;Did you mean: satfix-diddy&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: loves autocorrect
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] thinks urbit names need a canonical
pronunciation though
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: perhaps in a future continuity error
that&amp;#39;ll be my nickname
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: continuity era
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: :-|
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: S-Diddy?
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: S-diddy and the partyvan
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] thinks &amp;quot;tasfyn-partyv&amp;quot; needs to rhyme with
&amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s fine part hive&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: otherwise the ambiguous schwa rules all
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: actually name pronunciation merits some
less-un-serious thought at some point
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: indeed it does
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; just pronounces it with as neutral of an accent as &amp;#39;e
can manage.
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: one guy in particular was pretty curious
about it
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: one is always overly surprised to meet a
&amp;quot;cousin&amp;quot; differing by only one syllable
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but statistically this will be pretty darn
common
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: birthday effect and all that
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: your mind has to learn to disambiguate
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: as it already does with common English names
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Laura, Lauren.
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Any thoughts on timetable for
ACL&amp;#39;s, even as proof of concept? Or is the idea to delay Stallman&amp;#39;s nightmare
of the choice for data segregation as long as possible?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that needs to come in as part of our
forthcoming arvo design/cleanup pass
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it will probably still be preliminary but a
little smarter
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: obviously &amp;quot;everyone can read everyone else&amp;#39;s
files&amp;quot; is not an acceptable permanent solution
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] is not sure that &amp;quot;extant&amp;quot; is smarter than
the alternative
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: (like most of what I say, that was not
intentionally Zen)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: no, but it was intentionally confusing?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] did not recall saying &amp;quot;extant,&amp;quot; or even
&amp;quot;sextant...&amp;quot;
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: atax1a, you are lucky, I only know two people who even
half understand Urbit or care to try
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that&amp;#39;s an ideal position to be in - too cool
for school
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the basic problem is that the technology is
wildly overkill for the problem it can actually solve right now - ie, chat
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: the joke was that we currently don&amp;#39;t have
ACLs
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but once we get to the point where we start
killing other things
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: anterior cruciate ligament?
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: although I realize that we sort of do,
just not really
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is still confused
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: although, we do have ACLs in that you can only
get %cx from other ships
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: or %c*, rather
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but what you can&amp;#39;t do is go in and dereference
their private keys
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] fears the day that urbit develops anterior
cruciate ligaments
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: unless they can get you to run their programs
over the network
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: be very afraid of yebyen&amp;#39;s little chat program,
he has that lean and hungry look
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] does not run other people&amp;#39;s programs on zod or
doznec, at least not until he has an anterior cruciate ligament.
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: yeah I only needed to change about 12 characters to
make my own channel
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: it would be smart to keep estimates on
time-to-sentience for various computer-related thingies
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Easier than making your own
Bitcoin clone
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: fortunately we can see the source, so we know
whether you stole our keys
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I&amp;#39;ll continue to publish my desk number
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: ship/desk/...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is just joking, really
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: i can&amp;#39;t remember what it&amp;#39;s called
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we&amp;#39;re all friends here.  until we&amp;#39;re not
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: imrowan, do you know I made bitcrapd?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you can use :label, btw, to actually give it a
label...
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Just to see what would happen the
other day I ran :pope and got actual output that looked like a non-error, of
course all the carrier names are already determined
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: before it was cool to make bitcoin clones
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I was not aware of that
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s one thing to run :pope, another to be the
pope...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]  finds the pope&amp;#39;s hat pretty heavy sometimes
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I really enjoy the feature of testnet coins, that if
nobody mines for so long... the difficulty goes back to minimum
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: it&amp;#39;s something like an uptime guarantee
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Heavy lies the head that wears
the hat
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;caught me?  have some free *coins to cover for me!&amp;quot;
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: yebyen, *g* is actually being
unhelpful. Colour me surprised.
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: what?
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I am so helpful :)
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I&amp;#39;m trying to not-name Sergey&amp;#39;s
Frankenstein, for the opposite reason that I usually type G-d
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: you mean Mr. Bitcoin Satosh
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I win! yay 
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: If I knew how to program I would
make the next Google-That-Does-Not-Suck
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: It would aggregate G* results
with everything else, then strip out the irrelevant spam that G* now provides
two and three of just to make you extra blood-pressury
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Like Dogpile, only actually
useful
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has left the building
~talmul-noswed has left the building
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I&amp;#39;m out gambling bitcoins again
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I might actually win enough to bid 10.3BTC on ~nyt
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: If anyone actually fires up their carrier, I kind of
imagine they would come to ~doznec to announce it
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: perhaps
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: Someone is going to do it
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: So you are the zenmaster, who went to Germany?
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: Greetings! :) \/ ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan)
Rowan]: It would be interesting to budget a carrier, but I&amp;#39;m unable to comply
with the KYC requirement, and not in a moral or philosophical way. If I were
truly ack&amp;#39;d stateless I could probably \/ find a way like Mr. Gogulski did.  \/
\/
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: master? hardly, but I do recall being in
Germany recently
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I was very interested to find the nostate domain on
the PHP &amp;quot;bitcoin library&amp;quot; after someone petitioned me to help them
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: build a Bitcoin casino...
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: Has anyone seen his Bitcoin PHP library? :)
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: Mr. Gogulski
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: They insisted it should be in PHP and MySQL
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: we did not talk again after that day.
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I was only familar with him
through nostate, then one day I see he bought a carrier
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I had never heard of nostate until he bought a carrier
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: Is it his blog, or is he on it because he has no
state?
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: Incidentally, all of his backup documents were
inaccessible to my get requests
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I never saw his proof of not having any state
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: It sounded plausible, I think he probably has forfeit
his passport and had it returned with all the pages punched
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: But I thought it was odd that Urbit folk said &amp;quot;I
accept your documents&amp;quot; and each of his &amp;lt;img src had invalid attribs
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: And he&amp;#39;s not here now, so not able to defend himself
of course
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Heh, valid XML or GTFO
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I just tried myself, I can see
the docs when I click on the images
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: OK, I believe you
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I&amp;#39;m at a JuiceSSH terminal, I can&amp;#39;t check
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I win again!
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I am beyond words.

district, about as unlike a Greek monastery as one can imagine
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: cgy, I&amp;#39;m in America now!  I will probably be out in SF in
a couple weeks
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: hey, I have at times been known to walk
mindfully
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: walking mindfully in this area means watching
the pavement beneath your feet very closely
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: to me the urban Americans now appear as futuristic
catsuit-clad Jetsonoid robohumans
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that&amp;#39;s basically the state of things
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: if you don&amp;#39;t count the loping orcs and
shambling zombies
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: well I mean there&amp;#39;s the basic
poop-avoidance algorithm, but that doesn&amp;#39;t take that many cycles. you give it
say five out of every hundred moments and you&amp;#39;re good.
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: next to whom I am sort of like a homeless person
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: (which I technically am)
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: really walking mindfully takes way more
focus than that
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: any homeless person would scoff
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: where&amp;#39;s your cart?  where&amp;#39;s your needle
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: good questions
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: I have to go walk mindfully in the KS countryside now
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] thinks satfex is understanding the poop
avoidance problem
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] means underestimating it
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: for one thing, it&amp;#39;s not all a case of mounds.
There are also plenty of smears.
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: okay. honestly?  you&amp;#39;re never going to
avoid all of the poop. I&amp;#39;m sorry.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: dog vs. human is also a big concern
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but it&amp;#39;s true, DNA testing of the bottom of my
shoes would reveal...
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: in other news, this raft implementation
is giving me lots of ideas on how to not implement raft
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: at least it&amp;#39;s not Greece, which has terrible
problems with goat poop
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: looks like berries.  but, not berries.
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot; has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] would rather hear how not to implement raft.
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: look upon my github repo and despair
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that&amp;#39;s a very general complaint which probably
applies to all github repos
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: if we knew all, we would despair of all...
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; despairs of rather a lot, these days.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but not of the urbits hopefully!
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which are advancing at a great pace though it&amp;#39;s
not necessarily obvious
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Urbit is what keeps me afloat in my rivers of despair,
which may be a really sad thing for the outside world
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: i use urbit as a motivational device for
the new programmers i encounter on irc
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we can only create one small spot of order in a
permanently disordered world
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but we have no order yet, all we have is the
hope of order
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the promise of order
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but one of the premises of this entire
adventure is that order creates its own support
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: men and women instinctively loathe chaos and
crave order
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: even when they&amp;#39;ve been taught to love chaos and
fear order...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] thinks that a destroyer&amp;#39;s cruiser should be
known as its &amp;quot;mother.&amp;quot;  as in, mothership.
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: that is why i bought &amp;quot;greyface.org&amp;quot;

~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Is which thing on?
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: i&amp;#39;m typing through a child process
spawned by node.js
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: i think it works?
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: is it standard for the chat to not
automatically play back?
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: i think i&amp;#39;m also getting everyone&amp;#39;s
names three times in the list
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: It plays back what you missed.  If you just :begin&amp;#39;d a
destroyer, you missed everything.
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: hm. this is an old one.
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: seeing your comment twice too
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: restarting.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: you may be running two chats.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: or three.
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: ah yes
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: ^x
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: there we go
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; now pronounces (1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; x) as &amp;#39;bex x&amp;#39;. Truly, the
ursprache is taking over.

~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] has left the building
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: I walked.
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: pretty mindlessly, though.
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: hmm, the last time but one that I :began a destroyer,
:chat played me back EVERYTHING
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a lot of hilarity is due to the fact that I
thought I could build a message layer without a session identifier
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it works pretty much sort of
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is trying to document mindfully.  or perhaps
mindlessly.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: bex is one of those happy coincidences of
naming that&amp;#39;s just... right.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but they&amp;#39;re not all like that
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] still thinks (lte 5 6) should be no and (lte 6
5) should be yes
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: or maybe they should be curried?  but it would
be an enormous pita
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: to change
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: that is not a yak i would want to approach.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: many sherpas are killed by yaks every year
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you&amp;#39;d change it gradually, you&amp;#39;d create a new
arm that did it the new way
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and gradually shift users over to the new
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and then change the names back
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] does this kind of stuff all the time cuz he has
a language written in itself
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yall should see what it takes to change hoon in
hoon
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; hopes to see sometime.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you will, but it has already been substantially
domesticated
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: what it took to make the first hoon in hoon...
only I know and I don&amp;#39;t even remember
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: I heard it required some watt.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] changed to become more googleable.

~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i come bearing a functional curve25519
implementation
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: / ~tomsyt-balsen/try=/bin/curve/hoon
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: all bugs have been destroyed
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and it now actually does proper diffie-hellman
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i.e. actually key-compatible with djb&amp;#39;s
reference spec 
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: now to write aes and ed25519
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and we&amp;#39;ll have our cryptosuiteb
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: is it fast enough to run without a jet?
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: eh, not really, no
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i mean you could
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and it&amp;#39;d be about as fast as the RSA we have now
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: but why not use the jet?
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: it&amp;#39; free..
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] has left the building
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: just curious... since the underlying stuff
(muliplication, shifting) is already jetted

~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: wow, burnham
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: you get a piece of cheese for that
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: that&amp;#39;s about... 1/15 of my cheesespace
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: heh heh
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hopefully it&amp;#39;s goat cheese
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Interesting!
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: cheese comes in %goat %sheep and
                              %cow, but he can pick
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: I wish I&amp;#39;d brought some pieces of γίδα
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: pretty cool
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the ag department would probably confiscate
them
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] once brought a bunch of magic mushrooms back
from Japan in a jar full of miso
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: not among the smartest things he did in his 20s
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] doesn&amp;#39;t think the miso was very good for the
delicate chemicals anyway
~rigryx-sovrus &amp;quot;atax2a&amp;quot; did some pretty dumb things in the 20s.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hopefully the Kellogg-Briand pact wasn&amp;#39;t one of
them
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but I figured, who smuggles drugs in from
Japan?
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne] is in the building
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: an airport security drone in the UK really wanted to take
my cheese, but her boss wouldn&amp;#39;t let her
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: at that time you could actually buy them on the
street in Shibuya
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: some sense remains in the UK
~rigryx-sovrus &amp;quot;atax2a&amp;quot; smuggled cannabis out of Burning Man once. That was
pretty dumb.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: what
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: yeah, that was a mistake, 2
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: What, using sovrus, or doing the thing?
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; says, rhetorically.
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: that you had anything left to export
~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: The list of dumb things I did in my 20&amp;#39;s would
be lengthy.
~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: I&amp;#39;m pretty sure the statute of limitations
hasn&amp;#39;t expired on all of them.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: speaking of being in my 20s,
i&amp;#39;m gonna be in SF during the last week of february
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: I&amp;#39;ll be in SJC for a perfectly normal convention in
the middle of January
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] has left the building
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] welcomes hatteb and all visitors to Tlon&amp;#39;s
offices, which are literally a stone&amp;#39;s throw from *three* cannabis stores
~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: Q: what does one call an expression in Nock?
~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: Like *[1 2]
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you&amp;#39;d have to be a pretty good throw though...
~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: I&amp;#39;m calling it an expression, but didn&amp;#39;t know
if there wasn&amp;#39;t a non-standar name for it.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a formula.  well, the 2 is the formula.
*[subject formula]
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: formula, it&amp;#39;s not just for your howling
six-month-old
~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: Thanks!
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; is more interested in the Tlon than the herbary.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] once brought his three-day-old daughter to the
pediatrician only to be told, &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t worry, but she&amp;#39;s starving to death.  take
her home and give her some formula.&amp;quot;
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t worry but&amp;quot;
~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: There&amp;#39;s probably a better way to phrase that.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s actually quite normal for them to lose
10-15% of body weight in the first week
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: even if they don&amp;#39;t get into your
mushroom-flavored miso
~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: Still kind of alarming that it happens. 
~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: The weight loss, not the finding the shrooms.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: everything about the process is alarming.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: anything biological is
alarming
~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: And how.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: things that aren&amp;#39;t biological
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: are also often alarming
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short] has left the building
~talmul-noswed: &amp;quot;pop, my butt is itching.  can you give me cream?&amp;quot;

~talmul-noswed has left the building
~talmul-noswed is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is in the building
~talmul-noswed: and Boudreaux&amp;#39;s Butt Paste comes to the rescue.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: is that the real name of an
actual product
~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: Totally is.
~talmul-noswed: in fact it is
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: you&amp;#39;re not joking
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: he&amp;#39;s not joking
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: woah
~talmul-noswed: http://www.buttpaste.com/
~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: Now that&amp;#39;s alarming.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i am actually laughing irl
~talmul-noswed: rumors that I smuggled magic mushrooms back from Shibuya in a
jar of Butt Paste, however, are entirely unconfirmed.
~talmul-noswed: nosryl-tarpem has four kids, he probably has to train them to
put Butt Paste on each other
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: free-choice Butt Paste in a special tray
~talmul-noswed suspects that nosryl-tarpem has a staff of Oompa-Loompas
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hey wait, I turned into talmul-noswed
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] needs to keep a firmer grip on who he is today
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: how did that go wrong
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: two windows
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: four virtual desktops
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: oh
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: yeah
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: enough destroyers to sink the entire island of
Hawaii
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: Butt Paste fumes
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is going to have to check what happens when you
have a thousand destroyers in the same chatroom
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] suspects that it would only take about 80 to
bring ~doznec to its knees
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: what is the solution?  a bigger, taller doznec?  more
doznecs?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a more optimized doznec.  possibly with better
backoff on the pings.  and yes, bigger, taller
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a cruiser simply has to be able to control 2^16
destroyers
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this is difficult with our poorly optimized
interpreted protocol path
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but the LLVM interpreter is making good
progress and we can always write a jet
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: 2^16 is a big number but not absolutely
terrifying
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: what is the first absolutely
terrifying power of 2
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: 1 ping a minute from 2^16 destroyers is 1000
pings/second
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you ought to be able to process a ping in a
millisecond, it aint doin that much
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: anything above 2^16 is terrifying :-)
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: ...  2^17
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: hmm
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there is also a lot of latent capacity to
parallelize
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the ping should not have any side effects and
not need to be saveed, it&amp;#39;s just to keep the tunnel open
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: is a ping a card?
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: no, you just said
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is.  it becomes a packet which is a card
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: oh wait yes
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: but doesn&amp;#39;t need to be saved?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but if the card has no effect on the state, it
need not be saved
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: hmmm
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we can ignore the fact that it happened
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: simply compare the two nouns
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s perfectly legit.  unlike a jar of miso
stuffed with magic mushrooms.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which, fyi, don&amp;#39;t taste very good plain, and
even worse with miso
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: probably better than Butt Paste though.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: at least one is For Human Consumption
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] suspects that Butt Paste is probably not only
nontoxic, but might even be tasty
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] the other day handed his son a childproof bottle
of gummies and said, here, can you take the lid off?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: his intent was to show him that it&amp;#39;s impossible
to get into the vitamin gummies by himself.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] turned his back and in 3 seconds the lid was
off, hmm
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: speaking of which, has to go put his kids in
bed
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: good night everyone!  and welcome
foptec-nacfed...
~foptec-nacfed [Colin (Elision) Stanfill]: thanks!

briefly

~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: and ~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; has left the building
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I guess it&amp;#39;s messages from novrud-hanweb that don&amp;#39;t
make it to satnum-maptux
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: tasfyn-partyv: you still owe me -p
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I have a feeling that&amp;#39;s my issue, the restrictive
firewall here (and crappy nat there)
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: about the best thing i can suggest at the moment is to
:report on the ships in question...
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: and probably all the way up the routing hierarchy,
from the one that&amp;#39;s out of comms?
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: the worst expected behavior is that they both fall
back to talking through ~doznec, I think
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: packets (:hi&amp;#39;s) from ~novrud-hanweb just don&amp;#39;t make it
to ~satnum-maptux
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: one way comm in the other direction
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I&amp;#39;m going to disco/recon, against my better judgement

uses
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: naturally
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: issues
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I&amp;#39;m on a Starbucks connection, so surprised
that anything routes
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I did get a port in that magic range, which our
firewall is willing to route
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: So that might be the reason it&amp;#39;s working
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it might be but it shouldn&amp;#39;t be necessary
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we should always route through zod if needed
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: as for A1 security...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has always heard that these big books of
requirements were appalling and bureaucratic
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] would like to be A1 secure but more in the sense
of the steak sauce
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: mmm... steak
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: The spirit of A1 without the
letter might be nice

~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: we&amp;#39;re in ~novrud-hanweb discussing the subject
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: THE SUBJECT, the most significant mystery of all
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: and shorthand tree addressing
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: so if -&amp;lt; means &amp;quot;left child of subject&amp;quot;
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: what is the subject
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: I don&amp;#39;t even know anymore
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: no man
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: - means head
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: + means tail
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: &amp;lt; head &amp;gt; tail
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: so -&amp;lt; ought to mean tail of head
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: - is *a* subject
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: but in batz you can also say +
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: that&amp;#39;s the tail
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: the whole noun is .
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: oh boy you&amp;#39;re right
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: mercy, mercy, I can&amp;#39;t anymore, I&amp;#39;m leaving the other
:room
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: and I&amp;#39;m wrong
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: whew, only one &amp;amp;
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: yes, back to ~doznec
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: that&amp;#39;s worth like half a chicken right there
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: afaik !: enables tracing, but don&amp;#39;t quote
me...
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: sounds like a pragma
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: ee hee hee, . gives you the whole subject, - gives you
its head, + gives you its tail
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: s/subject/???/
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: and .&amp;lt; .&amp;gt; -&amp;lt; -&amp;gt; +&amp;lt; +&amp;gt; are all things... except for
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: it can&amp;#39;t be the whole subject of everything
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: because THE SUBJECT has to contain... arvo...  doesn&amp;#39;t
it?
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: no, the subject is different depending on what context
you&amp;#39;re in
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: +&amp;gt;
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: er whoops
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: neither .&amp;lt; or .&amp;gt; are valid things
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: yeah because -+&amp;lt;&amp;gt; operate on an implicit subject?
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: dot is like /1?
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: so +&amp;gt; is a core
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: tail of tail?
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I don&amp;#39;t understand why .&amp;lt; is not
                              - and .&amp;gt; is not +
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: I am going to take a stab in the dark and
say that it is the arvo core, but I expect to be totally off base
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: +&amp;gt;, that&amp;#39;s that horrible ugly thing
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: well i mean when you type it at
                %batz and get some stuff
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: however, my Hoon has not progressed much
in a while beyond basic math functions
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: in ., what are the sigs?
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: trying to write a math library made me YEARN for hoon
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: artifact of the print formats for @da and
@p... and @ta?
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I think sig is a null when it looks like that
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: all alone on its own line, in .
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: oh right
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: and yes, it&amp;#39;s part of the print format
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: so . is... [[date name] ugly]

~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: and &amp;lt;||&amp;gt;
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: yes
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: whatever the fark that is
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I have this sneaking suspicion that if I tell you the

~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: well I&amp;#39;m not going to try it then
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: due to lack of chicken, I went and started building

~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: huh, an assert failure, no less
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: then I tried killing vere and that resurrected me
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: we should be reporting those...

~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: but then in what sense is it a core
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I still don&amp;#39;t really know what a core is
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: &amp;quot;core&amp;quot; may have not been the best of

~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: HOORAY
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] really is about to document this
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the problem with the app subject is that it&amp;#39;s a
relatively mature application framework
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: so then =&amp;gt;  .(-&amp;lt; `who=@p`-&amp;lt;) means use -&amp;lt; as the subject
for that other thing
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and has a whole lot of funky stuff that various
applications would mean
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: arg
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: I would like SO MUCH to see that subject all diagrammed
out
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: inasmuch as it were able
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it means, take the subject and replace `-&amp;lt;`,
ie, nock /4, with nock /4 cast to `who=@p`
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: sweet
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: that&amp;#39;s different from `@p` because... I&amp;#39;m sure extant
hoon doc mentions this
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so the subject you start an application with is
[[identity application-path] library-stack]
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but we don&amp;#39;t give them names, because that
seems like cheating
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: why?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: suppose you don&amp;#39;t speak English?  well, it may
be too nitpicky
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: oh right
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: well okay, they have essences and fixed locations, that&amp;#39;s
better than a name
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] tries not to bind variable names automagically
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes, they do, -&amp;lt; at that level will never
change
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: identity is *my* identity?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the program has to know (a) where it is run
from, (b) who is running it
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this is the basics of configuration, a config
file can replace this with something more complex
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there is a whole funky configuration loading
path which hasn&amp;#39;t been used at all yet
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but will eventually be needed at the OS level
for complex apps
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which need, of course, config files
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: you can&amp;#39;t just store config in a variable?
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: sorry I disappeared
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: your configuration may and will be a single
noun, ie, - at the top of the file as it were
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this noun may be arbitrarily complex, it may
contain one label or several
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so, as a way of providing a kind of &amp;quot;default
configuration,&amp;quot; we provide
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: oh, to source parts of it from different places...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the simple pair of [identity application-path],
with no labels
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you may want cascading configurations for
bundles of apps, etc
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: application-path is a filesystem path?
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: what am I saying.  global immutable namespace path!
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes it is.  it&amp;#39;s okay to say filesystem... I
say it myself...

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: what&amp;#39;s the last line?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the last line is the most significant
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the top of the stack
~roppec-sampyx &amp;quot;Lysergic Spooner&amp;quot;: Last line before the exit: !  /~roppec-sampyx/arvo/ ~2014.1.10..17.22.41..5f8c/batz/:&amp;lt;[351 15].[351 47]&amp;gt;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: agh, that&amp;#39;s yet another case of &amp;quot;the thread was

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: some listener was not properly cancelled
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: batz is due for a big rewrite that should
eliminate all these problems
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but doc takes the priority
~roppec-sampyx &amp;quot;Lysergic Spooner&amp;quot;: *nods*

water

was sent to it anywas&amp;quot; errors. %work has those in spades.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: batz actually has a very solid causal mechanism
for deregistering listeners when a thread/task goes away
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Speaking of, I should have some free time on~2014.1.20 to visit Tlon HQ.

day...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] seconds the suggestion, after all, THAT&amp;#39;S WHAT

~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; remembers them working better than both revision

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: urbit is nothing but urban.

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] does think of Steve as hobmed
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we do need a one-face policy in the long run
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: or the medium run
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: when we get over needing lots of spare

destroyer for :chat?  You know, unless you have a good reason.&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that&amp;#39;s exactly how :-)
~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: Brilliant.
~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: Probably won&amp;#39;t scale very well as a policy,
but probably scales better than I would think.

~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: if an application&amp;#39;s subject is [[identity

~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: then what&amp;#39;s batz&amp;#39;s subject?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: at the kernel level?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: batz itself is a vane
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: batz itself is a vane and starts with simply
the hoon.hoon kernel stack
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: no state
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: then it pushes its own state on top of it
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: [batz-state kernel-stack]
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you can see it in batz.hoon if you look at
&amp;quot;section 4bC, shell vane&amp;quot;
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: oh!  that&amp;#39;s why . at the prompt gets you something like
[[identity date] ugly]
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: oh I see what you mean
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: no, that is the subject batz gives to
expressions on the command line
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: that&amp;#39;s what I wanted to ask
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: totally different from the application subject
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that one is created in ++food at line 1084
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is lookin at it now
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] warns the audience that it will probably change
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we throw in: the time as a time, the time as a
text span, your name as a @p, your name as a text span,
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the results of previous computations,
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: that&amp;#39;s &amp;lt;||&amp;gt;?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the variable state (that&amp;#39;s why =foo %bar works)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes, not sure the &amp;lt;||&amp;gt; is operating quite
correctly
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but basically, the idea is - stuff you need in
a command
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: all this will probably be changed a little bit
when we do our combined arvo doc/cleanup pass
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the goal with what&amp;#39;s there was to get a stab at
it
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but you can see why it&amp;#39;s different from the
application subject
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: so the tail of . is the variable state?  the salad in &amp;lt;&amp;gt;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that&amp;#39;s exactly right
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] has left the building
~midlys-rocpet [John Burnham] is in the building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; is bemused by the @p and @da having text-span versions.
Almost like you did that to break the runes someone came up with, and force
them to use names. :)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Urbit works now. For some values of “work.” To be exact, it’s a pretty decent replacement for IRC. And since it’s a pretty decent replacement for IRC, and bored geeks are what they are, we use it as a replacement for IRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike IRC, the Urbit chat server (:room) logs everything. We thought we’d turn this vice into a virtue and start posting our daily chat logs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado: Urbit, &lt;code&gt;~2014.1.6&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is happy to announce that (his private branch
                of) Hoon is now frozen
~ligfed-famsef &amp;quot;γίδα βραστή&amp;quot;: hooray!
~ligfed-famsef &amp;quot;γίδα βραστή&amp;quot;: what temperature?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: 164 I think
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: still working on the version numbers
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we will then have, sigh, another continuity
                breach...
~sivbud-barnel [Bruce Schwartz] is in the building
~nibweg-sivnex is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: sivbud, is this hoon stuff making more sense
                to you?
~patsec-rigreb [Benedikt Gerhard (Hanfer) Kleiner] is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: welcome patsec-rigreb
~patsec-rigreb [Benedikt Gerhard (Hanfer) Kleiner]: Hi
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we will have a continuity breach (reboot the
                world) soon, don&amp;#39;t worry it&amp;#39;s not something we do often :-)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] strongly recommends working through the Nock
                doc for all new users
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and old users as well
~patsec-rigreb [Benedikt Gerhard (Hanfer) Kleiner]: i just started .... im
                about to read the nock part...
~ligfed-famsef &amp;quot;γίδα βραστή&amp;quot;: if I were writing Nock doc for five-year-olds,
                it would have a lot of explosions
~ligfed-famsef &amp;quot;γίδα βραστή&amp;quot;: somehow it just feels like the formula is...
                *detonating* the subject
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ideally they would be animated with lots of
                noise as well
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has a five-year-old girl for which this
                treatment may not be ideal
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] needs to find a way to make the subject be a
                princess.
~ligfed-famsef &amp;quot;γίδα βραστή&amp;quot;: we&amp;#39;ll have an explosions version and a
                princesses version
~ligfed-famsef &amp;quot;γίδα βραστή&amp;quot;: and an explosions-and-princesses version for
                %punks
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] &amp;#39;s daughter might go for the
                explosions-and-princesses
~patsec-rigreb [Benedikt Gerhard (Hanfer) Kleiner]: i might go for the
                explosions-and-princesses version :D
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: no princesses can explode, that would scare
                her
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: they would have to be very sparkly
                explosions...
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: hello martians
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: good morning malmec-libsev
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: are you surprised that this just works?
~nibweg-sivnex has left the building
~sivbud-barnel [Bruce Schwartz] has left the building
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: I understand now what you meant by
                building an identity abstraction layer being like zoo 
                design, I think. Identities aren&amp;#39;t commensurable across 
                systems. Urbit ships, email addresses, ssh keys, and 
                passports all express different concepts that can&amp;#39;t
                be abstracted away.
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: I am less surprised that this works
                than, say, XMPP working.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it still surprises me if XMPP works :-)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] forgets whether Google has federation turned
                on or turned off at the moment
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: I worked on a SIP-based VoIP stack a
                few years ago. My metric for surprise has been calibrated a
                little differently ever since.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but yes, it&amp;#39;s very difficult to imagine any
                kind of app that treats~tasfyn-partyv and curtis@tlon.io as
                instances of the same thing
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: was SIP ever really a functioning standard?
                I mean, if your stack spoke SIP and mine did too, did that 
                just mean we could chat?
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: Yes! If there was no NAT involved. :)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: did SIP for instance have a standard
                required codec that everyone could fall back to?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: urbit will actually do TURN, effectively, if
                your NAT is too sucky
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: all the packets will be forwarded through
                ~zod
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: well, SIP was just signalling, it
                didn&amp;#39;t handle media. RTP was the media stream, and I don&amp;#39;t 
                think there was a required codec.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but this only happens if &amp;quot;bad NAT&amp;quot; is
                talking to &amp;quot;bad NAT&amp;quot; - then there&amp;#39;s no way around TURN.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I do know this about SIP
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the separation of media and streaming into
                two protocol categories - both of which have to work if you
                want to talk -
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: is good IETF politics, but that&amp;#39;s about it
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: Right. Some bad NATs will work if you
                can get both sides to start talking to each other 
                simultaneously. But that&amp;#39;s sort of a fine shade of 
                difference
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: because it will reuse the same port anyway?
                yicks.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we haven&amp;#39;t had any apparent NAT problems on
                urbit for a little while, knock on wood
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: here, I&amp;#39;ll use private messaging to send you
                a packet directly...
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: yeah. as a result of our experience
                with that, we started on a generalized NAT-holepunching 
                library (after noticing it was impossible to send a file 
                over the internet), but ran out of time and money.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ha, I spoke too soon, my client is still
                trying to punch a hole to you
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: anyway SIP was the only thing that did
                that AFAIK. H.323 and IAX both had in-band signalling
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: oh, now I see &amp;quot;&amp;lt; doznec:&amp;quot;
~patsec-rigreb [Benedikt Gerhard (Hanfer) Kleiner] has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ah, now my communication reached you
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: yep
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we are neighbors, we&amp;#39;ve exchagned keys
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: nice.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: have to figure out why it took so long
                though
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: for one thing, my congestion control is
                utter sh*t
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but in any case, the whole effort at
                producing IETF standards was really doomed
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: what do people use to talk on the internets
                today?  proprietary clients
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: well, supposedly the separation meant
                you could do things like third-party call control, where the
                signalling went through a controller host but the media 
                stream went between clients directly
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: why?  basically in my book because IP
                chickened out on the identity problem
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that&amp;#39;s a case of features pursuing a problem
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: or more precisely, that&amp;#39;s a case of people
                who sell legacy PBXes imposing their requirements on an 
                internet standard
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: SIP is still used in VoIP desk phones,
                and I think that was the original use case
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]  hasn&amp;#39;t seen a desk phone, VoIP or otherwise,
                in a while
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the new cool-kid companies don&amp;#39;t have
                internal phone systems at all...
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: yeah. Generals fighting the last war.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you just can&amp;#39;t deploy a new standard on the
                internets these days, in any case
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]  is really not even quite sure why IETF still
                exists.
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: well, it&amp;#39;s nice to still have a
                standards body that isn&amp;#39;t the W3C
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: (as a reminder of how things could have
                gone)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]  is also not sure why the W3C exists :-)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there was real greatness in the IETF, but
                not as much as there could have been
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the whole DNA of IP networking incorporates
                the assumption that basically it&amp;#39;s a network of trusted 
                parties, way too deeply
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: if you expose a new service it will simply
                get spammed to death
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the only reason we have port 25 is that
                email existed before spam, so it was worth saving
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: yeah.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so, that&amp;#39;s basically why we&amp;#39;re shipping a
                new layer, not a new service on the old layer.
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: sure. I think my tolerance for
                compatibility with old crap is greater than yours; perhaps 
                as much greater
                as your tolerance for engineering compromise is over 
                Stanislav&amp;#39;s. :)
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: A complementary approach to the spam
                problem, I think, is to build services that can function 
                with bounded levels of trust --
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there are different ways of doing
                compatibility with old crap
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: your ship, for instance, is actually a
                pretty decent HTTP server...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the basic principle is that the old crap can
                depend on us, but we can&amp;#39;t depend on the old crap
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: Right, I do remember that part. Makes
                sense.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: also, the minimum level of trust is
                essentially the knowledge that an identity is a unique or at 
                least identifiable individual
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: or at least, a *finite* individual in some
                sense.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you really can&amp;#39;t do anything with an
                infinite-identity system.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: IPv4 addresses come really close to being an
                excellent finite-identity system, but they are too wrapped up 
                in routing topology.
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: For some values of anything. There are
                still things that make sense as coin-operated services, I think
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: then you have the knowledge that someone has
                paid a coin - again, finite in some sense.
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: Right. But not strongly tied to
                identity.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: right.  but you know what identity paid a
                coin.  so even in an infinite space, it enters the subspace of 
                coin-paying identities.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but it&amp;#39;s moot, as IPv4 never established a
                payment model either.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: easy to imagine what the Internet would have
                been if BTC had been part of it from the beginning :-)
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: Sure. It&amp;#39;s almost moot to talk about IP
                these days; the set of hosts you can exchange IP packets with 
                is much smaller than the set you can establish a TCP (or HTTP!)
                connection with
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes.  this is all part of the general
                pattern of &amp;quot;use the internets as a modem.&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is a fairly good modem... but...
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: Bryan Ford and friends have been
                thinking about how to cope with this: 
                http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/2009/tng/
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: well, that&amp;#39;s a nice publication.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: good luck with your chicken-and-egg
                problem...
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: heh yes
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you can always publish something in the
                &amp;quot;Journal of Herculean Solutions to Problems Everyone Stopped 
                Trying To Fix Many Years Ago&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this is why I left academic CS, they are
                always making up problems which sound real but aren&amp;#39;t, then 
                solving them
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I am now capable of skimming a paper in 30
                seconds and finding the unrealistic assumption which makes the
                problem interesting
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: Certainly. Worse, when they do find a
                real problem, it still has to be couched in the same language 
                and format
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: in this case that would be, &amp;quot;we can get
                everyone to install flow boxes for our new transport protocol 
                in their DMZs&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this is what I call the &amp;quot;City Lights
                problem&amp;quot;
~sivbud-barnel [Bruce Schwartz] is in the building
~nibweg-sivnex is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you can see it if you go upstairs to the
                poetry room at City Lights bookstore in SF
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: As a fan of Ferlinghetti, I
                approve this analogy
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: on the walls are probably about 7,000 works
                of modern poetry, perhaps 20 or 30 of which are worth reading
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but they all look the same on the outside...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Ferlinghetti had it easy, he did his thing
                before the legion of Ferlinghetti imitators arrived
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: well, the stuff they were working on is
                getting new transport protocols to fit through old ones, as I
                understand it
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: since installing new boxes is
                infeasible
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I admit imitating him
                shamelessly in grade school
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: the argument basically being &amp;quot;TCP is
                the new bottom layer of the interwebz&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: when something is too easy to imitate,
                social cues determine who succeeds
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I take exception to this, I do believe UDP
                can be made to work
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but your home isn&amp;#39;t really part of the
                interwebz, still less your cell phone
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: If only the new documentary on
                him didn&amp;#39;t suck (I don&amp;#39;t know, I just assume it will)
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: I would like UDP to work. But as you
                say, it&amp;#39;s hard to get into your home and harder to get into 
                your cellphone
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Isn&amp;#39;t that just as much due to
                widespread natting?
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Which UDP seems to punch
                through with less issue
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: On a first-world home internet
                connection yes.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: exactly, but not even on a cellphone
                internet connection
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: these are typically not full-cone AFAIK
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but on a cellphone, you should only be
                talking to your ship in the cloud
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Intriguing (I had to look up
                full cone)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and running your urbit ship at home is only
                for those who truly fear the NSA/CIA/FBI etc
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I&amp;#39;d feel safer running an
                Urbit ship on a cloud VPS than I would a Linux distro
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I would too, but I don&amp;#39;t fear the NSA
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: *to clarify, &amp;quot;than I would
                running a Linux distro on a cloud VPS&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I fear machine outages - nb, we are putting
                Raft in the event logging system to create a genuinely 
                reliable server
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I fear the NSA less than the
                local cops, and data loss on a par with anything that threatens
                my physical safety
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Raft? Another
                Stephenson-inspired naming?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this is Ousterhout&amp;#39;s replacement for Paxos
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: don&amp;#39;t know the origin of the name...
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Wow (reading RAFT)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: once zod/doznec are protected by this, and
                we have conquered the continuity issues, dataz will never be 
                lost
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] now feels reasonably confident he could
                change the type of type type, without losing continuity
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: continuity breach warning is flashing RED
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Happy New Year!  And welcome to Hoon 164.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Hoon is now frozen for the reasonably
                short-term future.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: More documentation is coming soon...
~roppec-sampyx &amp;quot;Lysergic Spooner&amp;quot; is in the building
~roppec-sampyx &amp;quot;Lysergic Spooner&amp;quot;: Apparently I am immortal, having proven I
                have no life
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan] is in the building
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Yep, that&amp;#39;s the shortest chat
                backlog I&amp;#39;ve seen yet *g*
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has left the building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes we seem to exist again, gentlemen
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I always worry that the breach instructions
                are not as accessible as they should be
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: with a significantly cooler hoon. :D
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes it is, better wear at least some
                underwear before you go outside at 164
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: always nice to see the core group show up
                when we reboot the world
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; just happens to procrastinate on going to sleep every
                time you do that :)
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: well, we are well-versed in the ritual of the
                continuity breach.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: fortunately it&amp;#39;s a ritual that is becoming
                rarer and rarer
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but my concern is for those with weaker
                attachment
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: I was expecting doznec to be herd-thundered into
                unresponsiveness in those first minutes, but go figure
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: one thing we&amp;#39;re going to do is put a live
                chat window on urbit.org, output only...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: none of us was chatting much over the
                christmas break, it helped keep the numbers down
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; can only imagine what it&amp;#39;s like to breach continuity
                on~zod. &amp;quot;It must be one step hairier than doing~doznec, eh?&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: no, it&amp;#39;s really very simple, you just run
                with -c.
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: make an RSS feed of that chat window, while at it
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I think I&amp;#39;ll also start posting regular
                dumps to the urbit blog.
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: ...or that, yeah
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: including only %white discourse, of course.
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: still, I picked the right time to go %punk
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I really want to eventually enforce a
                one-face rule on people
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so that the shipname gets remembered better
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this will be easier when sh*t isn&amp;#39;t
                constantly breaking
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: one-face as in once chatty ship per person or same
                name on all ships the person is using to chat?
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: s/once/one/
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: one chatty ship per person.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: enforced only with weak social pressure.
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: and how would you enforce that?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hardly at all.  well, new users get only one
                destroyer.
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: gah, you type faster than I think
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the point is to have one ship, one user be
                normal
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: of course not everyone has to be normal.
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: so yachts don&amp;#39;t get to chat?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: certainly not directly.
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: ah
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there are only 2^32 reputations.  so even if
                :room accepted messages from a yacht they&amp;#39;d be listed under 
                its destroyer.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; understands yachts to be pleasure vessels.
                Destroyers are... something else entirely.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: don&amp;#39;t sail away with the metaphor!
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yachts are client ids.  destroyers are
                servers.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: actually I think we&amp;#39;ll change it to &amp;quot;yawls.&amp;quot;
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: destruction can bring pleasure!  as can cruising and
                carrying, of course
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so, for instance, a yacht is tied to a
                browser persona via cookies
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: well, you can pack a yawl with explosives.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; is suitably re-metaphored.
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: explosive cookies
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has no actual plans to do jihad.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; snickers.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] explains that &amp;quot;Urbit is the greater jihad.&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] exhorts all jihadis to cancel their
                pressure-cooker orders and learn Nock.
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: oh, the proper term is &amp;quot;pop rocks&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] used to smuggle pop rocks into Singapore,
                double-sealed in a rectal condom.
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; &amp;#39;m mind is now hung, trying to decide whether &amp;quot;rectal&amp;quot;
                refers to type of product, placement thereof, or both
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but one day the latex broke and... let&amp;#39;s
                just say it was embarrassing.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so he became a programmer instead.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] was just thinking of
                http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah_Hassan_Al_Aseery.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: an old buddy of mine, Abdul, he should have
                stuck with the pop rocks
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: who knows perhaps he did.  amount matters
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: well, it&amp;#39;s a fact that Prince Nayef wasn&amp;#39;t
                that badly injured...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] imagines missions deep into the secret heart
                of Yemen, convincing the local explosives engineers that pop 
                rocks are really PETN
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: in other news, does anyone know why lldb on
                Mavericks thinks all my corefiles are corrupt?
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: not offhand
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: error: core.88781 is a corrupt mach-o file:
                load command 440 LC_SEGMENT_64 has a fileoff + filesize 
                (0x5a438000) that extends beyond the end of the file 
                (0x5a437000), the segment will be truncated
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it could be the result of our mmap abuse,
                perhaps...
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short] is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: any difficulty with the continuity breach,
                malmec?
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: there was a slight hiccup i think?
                after :begin, I got &amp;quot;request approved&amp;quot;, a... martian file 
                listing, i guess,
                then a &amp;quot;save: gc:&amp;quot; line, then it stopped at &amp;quot;waiting&amp;quot; until 
                I hit ^D
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: but then i got the usual try prompt
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; remembers that bug being around for a while, but
                isn&amp;#39;t sure what to do to fix it.

~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; has a copy of that in a &amp;quot;recently read&amp;quot; stack. If I
                wanted to be completely derivative, I could ape his style...
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: after reading
                http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/mickens/
                thisworldofours.pdf I started to get suspicious
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: &amp;#39;I’ll look at the abstract for the
                talk, and it will say something like this: “It is well-known 
                that five-way secret sharing has been illegal since the

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: malmec, your update was slow because our
                network only gets about 20k/s
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Interestingly, a mobile phone

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] would probably be appalled if he ever had a

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: at least I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s turing complete,

                well-functioning computers?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ideally we&amp;#39;ll use our well-functioning
                computers to create great new works of funny
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: And now we must calculate the discount ratio of
                future humor to see if its worth the costs.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: This sounds complicated to do deductively, however
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: ,so perhaps we should set up a &amp;quot;Future Human Humor
                Production&amp;quot; betting market.

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hey Apple, basic toolchain principles:
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: (1) -g always has the same result as -O, and
                vice versa.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: (2) the program always does the same thing
                in the debugger as plain.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] feels this LLVM gcc toolchain is not ready
                for prime time.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes, the repeated key exchange thing is
                definitely a problem
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: apart from anything, it effectively leaks
                memory

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I will fix this.  but, I have to fix the

                I already fixed this bug and git lost my change.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but then, I looked at the fix location and
                the fix seems to be there.  so...
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: doznec just became my neighbor again.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s a little too neighborly for my taste
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I mean give it a rest, doznec...
~divsem-misdef &amp;quot;xulrunner42&amp;quot;: at least he doesn&amp;#39;t stomp on your ceiling like

~divsem-misdef &amp;quot;xulrunner42&amp;quot;: every time i hear their baby cry I think the
                sound that comes after must be the baby getting dropkicked
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: oh. yes I got 23 &amp;quot;~doznec is your

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes, that&amp;#39;s 23 key exchanges, decidedly
                suboptimal
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is sure he did something to break that...

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s the same thing I think, I just deleted
                the route timeout message

~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: last time i worked with a udp-based

~divsem-misdef &amp;quot;xulrunner42&amp;quot; has left the building
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: I have to wonder how well congestion

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: don&amp;#39;t know CCNx&amp;#39;s congestion control
                problem, but I know it&amp;#39;s more focused on multicast
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that seems harder...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: as for reimplementing TCP, there are of
                course several TCP algs to choose from
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we have the additional complication that our
                acks are end-to-end
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the ack is sent only after the packet is
                fully processed and committed
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is the same congestion control problem,
                but with a lot more variance because the internal round trip 
                is treated as part of the pathway
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but also, I just winged it with something
                crude that works
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: certainly not the way to get good CC

                there&amp;#39;s always the congestion-control algorithm from

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes I considered that one as well, though it
                prioritizes against interactive traffic
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s really the perfect project for a bright
                intern to spend a week on

~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Two weeks, if one didn&amp;#39;t know Hoon that well.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we&amp;#39;ll develop a Matrix style chip for
                learning Hoon.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: like doc but better...
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; would settle for doc.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: I also have a friend who did a Chicago
                implementation.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; knows we&amp;#39;re partial to raving with dj djb here...
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Chicago implementation?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Chicago implementation?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] wants to know if that&amp;#39;s a euphemism.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Dan Bernstein, perhaps.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: aka djb.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I know that part.  But not the Chicago.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: He&amp;#39;s at the University of Illinois at Chicago, but I
                don&amp;#39;t know what exactly is being implemented...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] somehow assumed it was UIUC.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Chicago, the congestion control algorithm specified
                somewhere around CurveCP. :)
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: From Wikipedia: &amp;quot;Bernstein explained, in 2005, that
                he is pursuing a strategy to &amp;quot;produce invulnerable computer 
                systems&amp;quot;. He plans to achieve this by putting the vast majority
                of computer software into an &amp;quot;extreme sandbox&amp;quot; that only allows
                it to transform input into output.&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ah.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Urbit is a sort of extreme sandbox...
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: http://curvecp.org/decongestion.html
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Thank you, atax1a.
~divsem-misdef &amp;quot;xulrunner42&amp;quot; has left the building
~divsem-misdef &amp;quot;xulrunner42&amp;quot; is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] will take a look.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: looks pretty reasonable, like most of the
                djb stuff
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; goes to read through the new, cooler, hoon.hoon.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the changes are all subtle... but...
~divsem-misdef &amp;quot;xulrunner42&amp;quot; has left the building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: any HEADSUP for the experienced reader?
~divsem-misdef &amp;quot;xulrunner42&amp;quot; is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hoons are now divided into twigs and tiles -
                this division used to be very unclear
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I guess that was in the previous checkin,
                but...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: in this one we have aliases, =*
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you can bind an alias as you pattern-match
                it
~monder-navryx &amp;quot;LarryH&amp;quot; is in the building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: How would i use tistar?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: if you say &amp;quot;=*  a  b&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s like &amp;quot;=+  a  b&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: except that b has to be a wing (resolve to
                an axis, not a computed expression)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and the subject noun is unchanged
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: also, when you pattern-match on your alias a
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: what you learn about an alias stays on the
                alias
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this eliminates a common problem where you
                know a type in too much detail
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and can&amp;#39;t for example bind something more
                general back into it
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: that clarifies matters a bit more.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; still doesn&amp;#39;t quite grok /===/try/app/hoon, except
                in broad strokes. At last check, fapp in batz launched an app 
                from the filesystem.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it does that...
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: the app... tisgar centis dot lus tisgar lus...
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;given the current subject, tack this core on&amp;quot;?
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;and invoke&amp;quot;??
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you&amp;#39;re deep in the heart of the funk my man
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; cannot tell if that&amp;#39;s a good thing.
~divsem-misdef &amp;quot;xulrunner42&amp;quot;: gotta have that funk!
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is a good thing.  but, it is probably not
                the best use of my time to explain ++fapp at the moment.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: sur.
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; is in the building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: +e.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hey, can everyone do a :reset?
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: now? no :update?
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: just :reset, no :update?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I am starting to suspect that some old code
                slipped in to the last urbit.pill.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: an :update can&amp;#39;t hurt.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but what I notice is that when I start
                reloading to find the bugs, the bugs go away.

~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; got a %clay update and successfully reset.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it certainly can&amp;#39;t hurt yo.
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: my computer is not as fast
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: got the same update on divsem-misdef, still doing
                :reset
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: what the %duce
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: sorry about that %duce
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: doznec is going up and down, update again
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the duce will be gone
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; is in the building

~roppec-sampyx &amp;quot;Lysergic Spooner&amp;quot;: Huh, this destroyer got the char restart
                on its own, the other was still trying. I update and reset this
                one and got it back already, the other&amp;#39;s still [waiting...] on 
                the :update.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Updated, reloaded %clay.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: still waiting on that update?  who&amp;#39;s
                waiting?
~roppec-sampyx &amp;quot;Lysergic Spooner&amp;quot;: waiting is~difryt-dapdeg
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hang on ....
~sarlug-picwep &amp;quot;ikari&amp;quot;: Not on the :update, but~fantyv-ralpen is waiting
                for~doznec.
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: it worked here,~divsem-misdef is still doing
                :reset but it did get the update, second time I tried
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hm... I see some unacknowledged messages...
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: first time it was just hanging having a hard time
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: tell you what - I have to go and pick up my
                kids
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: did you kill it, yebyen?
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: ^D
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: tried again, worked, should be back any second
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hm, I do prefer not working around things
                that are working badly...
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: at %vane %e
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: report the crime, don&amp;#39;t solve the crime
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but I encourage everyone with a waiting
                destroyer to leave it waiting for right now
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and if it keeps waiting, the drydock is the
                place for it...
~divsem-misdef &amp;quot;xulrunner42&amp;quot; is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: possible that doznec lost some events in my
                power cycle, though I kind of doubt it
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: sorry I didn&amp;#39;t save it for you, this device is an
                android tegra3
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: so it was pretty slow
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I can use a pier from an android tegra3,
                it&amp;#39;s all the same pier man
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: i thought it might just be slowness or intermittent
                network issue
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that is possible as well...
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: i&amp;#39;m sure you could use it
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: anyway, catch you guys later...
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: cheers!
~sarlug-picwep &amp;quot;ikari&amp;quot;: Vale.
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I noticed some weirdness with the ! quit the other
                day before the breach
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: i never tried ! to quit before, but it didn&amp;#39;t quit

~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot; is in the building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; was unaware that ! was supposed to quit.

~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: my faith in the TF700T is very thin
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: i&amp;#39;ve actually had a much better time with the tf100
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: i don&amp;#39;t know what happens to these two extra cores
                or that extra ram
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: but the tf100 performs much better with 2.6
                kernel/katkiss than this faster machine with 3.1 and 
                cyanogenmod
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: vere is basically unusable for divsem-misdef, too
                bad

~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: anyone out there?
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Present.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Though not for the auction.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: That was supposed to be today, wasn&amp;#39;t it?
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: It is today, it is happening now.
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I just heard it reported that the bid is at 7.1BTC
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: which is~0.1BTC more than I have
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I don&amp;#39;t know if just anyone can bid, or only those
                on the list
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: hackernews is back up, that&amp;#39;s good news
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: fantyv-ralpen: there&amp;#39;s also
                :~novrud-hanweb/try=/bin/chat now!
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Testing immediately.
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: if you&amp;#39;re in both rooms, you get all messages twice
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; has left the building

~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: fantyv
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: maybe :room changes too
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: How did you alter line 97?
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: changed all yo to oy, zo to oz
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: err...
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: you know
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: then I did the same in room, and it seems to have
                fixed everything without a reload
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Copy.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Test
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Should I make similar modifications?
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: i found this internet numbers station reading a
                totally random file: http://unified.cf.gs:8000/listen.pls
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: you aren&amp;#39;t reading any of that are you
                fantyv-ralpen
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Nothing, sorry.
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: you need to ^D my chat and start it again from
                :~novrud-hanweb/try=/bin/chat
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: you&amp;#39;ll get try/3
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Yes, expected as much. Doing so now.
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: i&amp;#39;m running a main/2/bin/room/hoon now, that fixed
                everything
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: but you need a client that listens on the right
                ports
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Just sent a test string. What port needs changing?
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: if you run~novrud-hanweb/try=/bin/chat you get the
                new version
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Just did.
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: i changed %yo to %zo and %oy to %oz
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: still nothing huh
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: maybe your old client needs to timeout first
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: you know, i&amp;#39;m not sure it worked
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Second test sent.
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: it&amp;#39;s harder because I don&amp;#39;t know what channel I
                received that message on
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Second test sent.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: That was in~doznec chat.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Just tried another yebyen-chat message.
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: yeah so it must not have worked
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: my = still doesn&amp;#39;t work
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Trying to connect to yy-chat with a second destroyer.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: [waiting...]
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I guess it did not work.
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: something must still look for %yo or %oy
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: but nothing in either of these files, room.hoon or
                chat.hoon
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: hello there ikari
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Sending messages to yy-chat from alternate destroyer.
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: i see sarlug-picwep is my neighbor, but that&amp;#39;s it
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: no messages
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: My ships can&amp;#39;t see each other inside yy-chat either.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Messages are only visible to the ship that transmits.
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I changed yo in room.hoon
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: line 163, [/zo [%lq %zo]]
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: and 187, and 153 had %oy, turned into %oz
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: don&amp;#39;t know why it didn&amp;#39;t work
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: but it&amp;#39;s late here on the east coast!
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: gotta work tomorrow, unless cold snap
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: peace ^_^
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Auf wiedersehen.

   <title>Urbit Is &#58; Chapter 0</title>
   <link href="http://urbit.org/2013/12/13/urbit-ch0.html"/>
   <updated>2013-12-13T17:23:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://urbit.org/2013/12/13/urbit-ch0</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greetings from the off-world colonies! I’m your guide and scribe, &lt;code&gt;atax1a&lt;/code&gt;, a character from a book that hasn’t been written yet. Every great book has a Chapter 0, though, and you are reading mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am often asked&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what_is_urbit&quot;&gt;What Is Urbit?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urbit could be a way of sharing your data in a way that makes it live forever. Maybe it’s a Facebook of memories, 140 Twitters of words, or an Instagram for when you’re a grandpa. Maybe you send Urbit an email. You can hit it with your web browser right now, but that’s a bit rough around the edges. (Given time, it could even be that BBS or MUD that you wanted, but could never have…) It could be anything — right now, we use it as a glorified chat program, but one that never loses messages. Well, almost never. Sometimes we have to reboot the Universe, and everything we haven’t backed up is lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may be getting the idea that Urbit is hard to define precisely. It is, because it isn’t finished yet. In reality, Urbit is just a labyrinth of code, written as a book, running on a virtual machine (possibly running on another virtual machine, and so on), built out of physical parts, and it’s read and written )and edited( by human mammals on a planet called Earth. (The Urbit computer follows a “Hears, knows, does” model, which I can explain later.) A lot of Earthlings call it an art project, which isn’t far off. Sometime it’s Dada, other times it’s baroque, but it always has a precise scientific backing in the form of &lt;em&gt;Nock&lt;/em&gt;, which are the fundamental axioms (rules) of the Urbiverse. Nock is all numbers, tho, and it’s tiring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urbit is also a programming language. We call that &lt;em&gt;Hoon&lt;/em&gt;, for reasons I’m still not quite clear on. It takes Nock’s numbers and puts symbols on them. They’re kinda weird symbols, and most “real” programmers I know (and work with) take one look at something like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;|=(x=@ ?:((lth x 2) 1 (add $(x (dec x)) $(x (sub x 2)))))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and go pale around the gills. Myself, I grew up speaking a language called &lt;code&gt;perl&lt;/code&gt;, which has an even bigger love-affair with special characters, so reading this doesn’t faze me (Hoon uses its special characters judiciously, so please don’t think of &lt;code&gt;perl&lt;/code&gt; unless you like that sort of thing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An earlier version of Urbit (when Hoon was still called Watt) was rejected from a real scientific conference because the judges felt vaguely insulted by the nonstandard language. The Urbit you’re looking at now has had a few years to cool down and mature, and right now it’s so cool at the core that it’s well below -400 Fahrenheit. Thankfully, there is an entire planet built up around its icy core, and on the surface of that planet, it’s a balmy 25 degrees Celsius, and the water is like glass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urbit is currently only usable by a hyperliterate set of people — it’s immersed in the culture of the word, and it’s struggling for a glimpse of air, the sound of music, and a taste of freedom. Really, though, it’s easy to teach yourself, if you work through it with a dedicated mind. Having a friend along for the ride is definitely recommended. People with prior programming experience are welcome, but be warned: your existing biases and expectations are wrong. We’ll try and be gentle about breaking them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why_should_i_care_the_buried_lede&quot;&gt;Why should I care? (the buried lede)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, Urbit is a single global computer. Think “Cyberspace” from &lt;em&gt;Neuromancer&lt;/em&gt;, or “The Metaverse” from &lt;em&gt;Snow Crash&lt;/em&gt;. If you’re really early, think of Haflinger’s worm from &lt;em&gt;The Shockwave Rider&lt;/em&gt;. But don’t think of it as the Internet — the internet is a single global &lt;em&gt;network&lt;/em&gt;, and it only follows two rules: you can act like a UNIX machine when prompted, and you speak TCP/IP. Anyone can see what you’re saying, and most people can understand it. There are gaps in the network, too: &lt;em&gt;The Great Firewall Of China&lt;/em&gt;, anyone? “Encryption”, or as I might call it, &lt;em&gt;privacy&lt;/em&gt;, is an afterthought, and people who Never Say Anything can read a lot of supposedly “private” things, just by doing the right math. &lt;em&gt;Urbit isn’t like that&lt;/em&gt;. It enables secure, private, computing, in a way that nobody else can, because it is “semantically isolated” — the meaning of the Urbit program is independent of the outside world (in this case, the Internet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urbit works like an Internet should. If you know someone’s address, you can send them a message. It will either reliably be delivered, or get rejected. Likewise with requesting something: if you ask for tomorrow’s newspaper headline &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;, Urbit will gladly give it to you… tomorrow. Your ship just waits for it to come in, and when it does, everything proceeds like normal. “HTTP 404 Not Found”? What the &lt;code&gt;!^&amp;amp;#&lt;/code&gt; does THAT mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;who_are_you_people&quot;&gt;Who ARE you people?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re dreamers, but the dream escaped and is slowly consuming the real world. We’re programmers with a sense of humor and an overload of whimsy. At the end of the day, though, we’re just people just like you. People who want to change the world. Everyone wants to change the world, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;and_what_is_with_all_of_the_weird_words&quot;&gt;And what is with all of the weird words?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urbit is a piece of technology. Unfortunately, technology is hard to explain, and it gets harder when the words we use to explain it are misunderstood. If you’re used to speaking about your computers in terms of a Unix (or Windows) workstation, it’s a bit of a leap to think in terms of Urbit ships in a pier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, we use weird words to force a change in how our technology is perceived. Without that, readers are likely to gloss over important details, thinking that they understand more than they really do. It’s why we redefine everything, change the pronunciation of the symbols you’re used to, and even have our own number system. Count with me, and feel free to scribble in the margins:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~zod 0   (also &amp;#39;yes&amp;#39;)                 if i were rewriting this
~nec 1   (no)                            i would put &amp;#39;can&amp;#39; b4
~bud 2   [the rest of the numberz        &amp;#39;change meaning…&amp;#39;
~wes 3        change meaning
~sev 4    according to context]
~per 5   ---
~sut 6   &amp;lt;but that&amp;#39;s 0kay&amp;gt;
~let 7   
~ful 8   
~pen 9   ¡you can figure it out!&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saying them out loud helps. You and your friend can agree on the pronunciation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;introductions&quot;&gt;Introductions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get in touch with me on Urbit, of course. Join up to &lt;code&gt;:chat&lt;/code&gt; and use &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; to see who’s in the room. On the old internet, I go by many names, but on this one I try to stick with &lt;code&gt;~hatteb-mitlyd&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Urbit Is Easy&#58; Chapter VIII (Gates)</title>
   <link href="http://urbit.org/2013/11/18/urbit-is-easy-ch8.html"/>
   <updated>2013-11-18T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://urbit.org/2013/11/18/urbit-is-easy-ch8</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;urbit-is-easy-ch7.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prev&lt;/strong&gt;: Hoon Computes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Anyone who thinks he’s original is merely ignorant.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(Nicolás Gómez Dávila)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s nice that we got decrement working in the last chapter. But we didn’t actually produce a decrement &lt;em&gt;function&lt;/em&gt;. So, let’s do that now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gates_and_lambda&quot;&gt;Gates and “lambda”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we can hardly stop you from saying “function,” the proper Urbit terminology is &lt;code&gt;gate&lt;/code&gt;. You might remember our discussion in chapter 4. A core is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[battery payload]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The battery is one or more formulas; the payload is any noun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a gate, which is a special case of a core, there is exactly one arm - whose name is &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;buc&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;blip&lt;/code&gt; - ie, nothing. One arm, one twig, one formula. Moreover, the payload is always a cell, arbitrarily labeled &lt;code&gt;sample&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;context&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So - to combine several ways of deconstructing a noun - a gate looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;           glus   gras
          lusgal lusgar
            +&amp;lt;     +&amp;gt;
[formula [sample context]]
    -          +
   hep        lus&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this remind you of anything? I hope not! Unfortunately some readers may be previously familiar with legacy functional languages from the late 20th century. Legacy? Perhaps this is a little sharp - let’s say “classical.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In classical FP, something quite like a Hoon gate is known as a “lambda.” We try not to use this term, really. Hoon is obviously not based on the lambda calculus, and it’s not nice to define other people’s words for them. (This is also why we don’t say “monad.”) But we may slip up sometimes and that’s okay. (We may also get caught with “closure” or even “continuation.”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is a big difference: in classical FP, “lambda” is a fundamental semantic primitive. Since these are &lt;em&gt;functional&lt;/em&gt; languages after all, it makes sense that defining and calling functions would be fundamental primitives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But gates - Hoon’s equivalent of functions - are no more than a design pattern: a convention, and a relatively funky convention at that. Plus some sugary macros that make things convenient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Hoon’s primitives are actually primitive (it doesn’t get much more primitive than Nock), we can combine them to produce not only classic, function-oriented FP, but also a broader garden of funky patterns at the same complexity level as function calling. But different from function calling. What? We’ll see some of these patterns in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we_make_a_gate&quot;&gt;We make a gate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal this time is not just to build decrement - it’s to build decrement &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;. That is, as a decrement function - a gate. If this is called &lt;code&gt;deq&lt;/code&gt; (there already being a perfectly usable &lt;code&gt;dec&lt;/code&gt;) and we want decrementing &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; to look like Lisp:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(deq a)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then we can expect our program to look something like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;!:             ::  To write a trivial Hoon program
|=  *          ::
|=  [a=@ ~]    ::  For educational purposes only
:_  ~  :_  ~   ::
:-  %$         ::  Preserve this mysterious boilerplate square
!&amp;gt;             ::
:::::::::::::::::  Produce a value below
=&amp;gt;  XXXXX      ::  some twig or other
(deq a)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This XXXXX twig, whatever it is, must extend the subject to contain a core which includes an arm which produces our gate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extend the subject to contain a core which includes an arm which produces our gate? Sure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=&amp;gt;  |%
    ++  deq
      =+  x=0
      |.  =+  y=0
          |-  ?:  =(x +(y))
                y
              $(y +(y))
    --
(deq a)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or more conveniently:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=&amp;lt;  (deq a)
|%
++  deq
  =+  x=0
  |.  =+  y=0
      |-  ?:  =(x +(y))
            y
          $(y +(y))
--
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;: /~zod/try/25/bin/hec/hoon
~zod/try=&amp;gt; :hec 42
41&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this doesn’t mean we understand it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, we read the last chapter. So we understand how and why &lt;code&gt;|%&lt;/code&gt; turned into &lt;code&gt;|.&lt;/code&gt;, which then turned into &lt;code&gt;|-&lt;/code&gt;. The loop. But this strange beast seems to contain… &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; cores?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we_understand_a_gate&quot;&gt;We understand a gate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course we need three nested cores. Actually, we have a lot more than three nested cores, because the subject we are getting for the application contains all of &lt;code&gt;zuse.hoon&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;hoon.hoon&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A stack of cores in which the core below is the context of the one above, all the way down to the innermost core whose payload is a simple constant (for &lt;code&gt;hoon.hoon&lt;/code&gt;, always the Kelvin version) is called, for obvious reasons, a &lt;code&gt;reef&lt;/code&gt;. With our three cores, we are adding no more than a few decorative polyps to our reef.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, we can just as well use the standard decrement, &lt;code&gt;dec&lt;/code&gt; - it’s in there too:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=&amp;lt;  (dec a)
|%
++  deq
  =+  x=0
  |.  
  =+  y=0
  |-  
  ?:  =(x +(y))
    y
  $(y +(y))
--
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(We’ve used a more conservative indentation here - uglier and less compact, but arguably clearer.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We define &lt;code&gt;deq&lt;/code&gt;, but we seem to be able to just call &lt;code&gt;dec&lt;/code&gt;. Why? Because we read past cores which don’t bind the arm we’re looking for, we can read all the way to the deepest layer in the Hoon 164 reef - which contains the official, original &lt;code&gt;dec&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(It remains important not to profoundly abuse this magic power. Every layer of core you add, of course, puts you farther from some of the gates you want to use. A smart interpreter can smooth over this issue a little, but smart isn’t free either.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, it should be perfectly clear what the three &lt;code&gt;bar&lt;/code&gt; runes - implying three cores - mean. First, we have the &lt;code&gt;|%&lt;/code&gt; which contains &lt;code&gt;++deq&lt;/code&gt;. (When referring to an arm in informal text, we use this syntax, though the actual language of course requires a double space - when searching in a file, “++ arm” will always find the definition of &lt;code&gt;arm&lt;/code&gt; and nothing else.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This outer core defines &lt;em&gt;the library our decrement gate is in&lt;/em&gt;. Obviously, this library (an unscientific term for a multi-armed core containing only static code and data) can contain gate producers other than &lt;code&gt;deq&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Actually, “library” here is not quite correct, because the payload of this core contains dynamic information such as &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;. It is really a case of that even more unscientific term, the “object.” (If you have any better words than “library” and “object” for these concepts, preferably four-letter Scrabble words as is our wont, the author is all ears.) This accidental object is a Hoon solecism - we are not actually using the dynamic state in &lt;code&gt;deq&lt;/code&gt;. We’ll fix it in a later version of the app.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every arm in a library, the subject is the library core itself. Naturally, the &lt;code&gt;|%&lt;/code&gt; twig uses its own subject as the payload, creating the familiar reef effect as the stack of cores piles up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this library is the &lt;code&gt;context&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;+&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;gras&lt;/code&gt;) of our gate. Thus, the twig in the gate can use anything in the library - of course as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;sample&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;+&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;glus&lt;/code&gt;) of our gate is simply any default noun for the type we want to compute on. Remember, of course, that the whole point of gates is that we change the sample, then compute the formula. Hoon is a typed language, so the sample can be safely replaced by any noun in the same type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within &lt;code&gt;=+&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;tislus&lt;/code&gt;, the old subject becomes the context, and the new subject adds the sample &lt;code&gt;^=(b 0)&lt;/code&gt;. This pair of sample and context then becomes the payload within &lt;code&gt;|.&lt;/code&gt; Hence, we build a gate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, within this gate - the third core is the decrement loop itself, as we built it in the last chapter. Note that if decrement did not need a counter variable or other incremental state, we would need only two cores - we could recurse through the decrement gate itself. We’ll see this in a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s eschew synthetic runes and show the three cores as they really are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=&amp;lt;  (deq a)
|%
++  deq
  =+  x=0
  |%  
  ++  $
    =+  y=0
    =&amp;lt;  $
    |%  
    ++  $
      ?:  =(x +(y))
        y
      $(y +(y))
    --
  --
--
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if we don’t mind synthetics and lots of parentheses, our decrement gate can also be a one-liner. This is perfectly legitimate Hoon style:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
|%  ++  deq  =+(x=0 |.(=+(y=0 |-(?:(=(x +(y)) y $(y +(y)))))))
--
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we_call_a_gate&quot;&gt;We call a gate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that we’ve still totally failed to explain &lt;code&gt;(deq a)&lt;/code&gt;. This is obviously an irregular form. Let’s try to turn it back into natural hoons, and figure out what it’s doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that &lt;code&gt;deq&lt;/code&gt; builds a gate. We already know how to change the sample, &lt;code&gt;+&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;glus&lt;/code&gt;, in that gate. So let’s drag it out and do it the ugly way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=&amp;lt;  =+  foo=deq             ::  create the gate
    =+  bar=foo(+&amp;lt; a)       ::  replace its sample
    $.bar                   ::  invoke the gate
|%
++  deq
  =+  x=0
  |.  =+  y=0
      |-  ?:  =(x +(y))
            y
          $(y +(y))
--
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this work? It’s always nice to check&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;: /~zod/try/28/bin/hec/hoon
~zod/try=&amp;gt; :hec 42
41&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t actually need a separate &lt;code&gt;bar&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=&amp;lt;  =+  foo=deq             ::  create the gate
    $.foo(+&amp;lt; a)             ::  replace the sample and invoke
|%
++  deq
  =+  x=0
  |.  =+  y=0
      |-  ?:  =(x +(y))
            y
          $(y +(y))
--
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what we’d actually like to be able to get away with is… something that &lt;em&gt;won’t&lt;/em&gt; work - but that looks like it might:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=&amp;lt;  $.deq(+&amp;lt; a)             ::  create, replace and invoke
|%
++  deq
  =+  x=0
  |.  =+  y=0
      |-  ?:  =(x +(y))
            y
          $(y +(y))
--
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We try it and - doh!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;: /~zod/try/31/bin/hec/hoon
~zod/try=&amp;gt; :hec 42
! /~zod/hec/bin/~2014.1.13..22.55.29..8975/try:&amp;lt;[2 1].[23 3]&amp;gt;
! /~zod/hec/bin/~2014.1.13..22.55.29..8975/try:&amp;lt;[3 1].[23 3]&amp;gt;
! /~zod/hec/bin/~2014.1.13..22.55.29..8975/try:&amp;lt;[4 1].[23 3]&amp;gt;
! /~zod/hec/bin/~2014.1.13..22.55.29..8975/try:&amp;lt;[4 8].[23 3]&amp;gt;
! /~zod/hec/bin/~2014.1.13..22.55.29..8975/try:&amp;lt;[5 1].[23 3]&amp;gt;
! /~zod/hec/bin/~2014.1.13..22.55.29..8975/try:&amp;lt;[6 1].[23 3]&amp;gt;
! /~zod/hec/bin/~2014.1.13..22.55.29..8975/try:&amp;lt;[8 1].[23 3]&amp;gt;
! /~zod/hec/bin/~2014.1.13..22.55.29..8975/try:&amp;lt;[8 5].[8 16]&amp;gt;
! type-fail
! exit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This means we had a type failure between columns 5 and 16 of line 8, by the way. More on troubleshooting errors later.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because when we wrote &lt;code&gt;deq(+&amp;lt; a)&lt;/code&gt;, we didn’t mean: compute &lt;code&gt;deq&lt;/code&gt;, then modify the &lt;code&gt;+&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt; of its result to be &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;. We meant: compute &lt;code&gt;deq&lt;/code&gt;, with the &lt;code&gt;+&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt; of the core that contains &lt;code&gt;deq&lt;/code&gt; - ie, with the &lt;code&gt;+&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;library&lt;/em&gt; - changed to &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;. Needless to say, that’s not what we want at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The change in &lt;code&gt;=%&lt;/code&gt; - remember that &lt;code&gt;deq(+&amp;lt; a)&lt;/code&gt; is a short form for &lt;code&gt;=%(deq +&amp;lt; a)&lt;/code&gt; - is always &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the invocation. So we can’t do this as easily as it looks like we should be able to do it - because we can’t edit the gate until we build it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, we have a synthetic hoon to do this. What hoon is (deq a), anyway? It’s &lt;code&gt;%-&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cenhep&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%cnhp&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=&amp;lt;  %-  deq
    a
|%
++  deq
  =+  x=0
  |.  =+  y=0
      |-  ?:  =(x +(y))
            y
          $(y +(y))
--
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at the definition of &lt;code&gt;%cnhp&lt;/code&gt;, our function caller. Here are the relevant clips from &lt;code&gt;hoon.hoon&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;++  twig
  |%  [%cnhp p=twig q=tusk]
  ==

++  tusk  (list twig)

++  open
  ^-  twig
  ?-    gen
      [%cnhp *]
    ?~(q.gen [%tsgr p.gen [%cnzy %$]] [%cncl p.gen [%cltr q.gen]])
  ::
      [%cncl *]  
    [%cnsg [%$ ~] p.gen q.gen]
  ::
      [%cnsg *]  
    [%cntr p.gen q.gen [[[[%&amp;amp; 6] ~] r.gen] ~]]
  ::
      [%cntr *]
    :+  %tsls
      q.gen
    :+  %cnts
      (weld p.gen `wing`[[~ 2] ~])
    (turn r.gen |=([p=wing q=twig] [p [%tsgr [~ 3] q]]))
  ==&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re not expected to understand this. At least, not yet. But we see that &lt;code&gt;%-&lt;/code&gt;, so far from being a primitive, actually is a special case of &lt;code&gt;%:&lt;/code&gt;, which is a special case of &lt;code&gt;%~&lt;/code&gt;, which is a special case of &lt;code&gt;%*&lt;/code&gt;, which seems to do… something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which probably makes you think &lt;code&gt;%cnhp&lt;/code&gt; is insanely complicated. Actually it just shows what an interesting family of things which are like function calls, but which are not function calls, we have here in Hoon. Defining &lt;code&gt;%cnhp&lt;/code&gt; this way saves code, but it doesn’t help us understand the humble function call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we just wanted %cnhp to be simple, we’d define it this way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;++  twig
  |%  [%cnhp p=twig q=twig]
  ==

++  open
  ^-  twig
  ?-    gen
      [%cnhp *]
    :+  %tsls  q.gen
    :+  %tsgl  [%cnzy %$]
    [%cnhp [[%&amp;amp; 2] ~] [[[%&amp;amp; 6] ~] [%tsgl [~ 3] p.gen]] ~]
  ==&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also is not terribly readable. Let’s translate it into the code that we’d write if we were writing this macro out by hand:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=&amp;lt;  =+  deq               ::  create the gate
    $.-(+&amp;lt; =&amp;gt;(+ a))       ::  replace the sample and invoke
|%
++  deq
  =+  x=0
  |.  =+  y=0
      |-  ?:  =(x +(y))
            y
          $(y +(y))
--
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare this to the working example above. The main difference is that this is what a Lisp fan would call a “hygienic macro.” It does not create private symbols of its own, or if it does they are not visible to the programmer. For instance, when we write&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;=+  deq&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;instead of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;=+  foo=deq&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we see how wrong it is to think of the latter as “declaring a variable &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; and assigning it to &lt;code&gt;deq&lt;/code&gt;.” Actually, we have no need within a synthetic hoon to bind a name. After the &lt;code&gt;=+&lt;/code&gt;, we can reach the gate with just &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we cannot simply replace the sample with &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; - because the programmer who wrote &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; meant to write a twig against the original subject, not against the cell of gate and subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, &lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt;(+ a)&lt;/code&gt; gets us our original subject back - and &lt;code&gt;%-&lt;/code&gt; works exactly as if it was a natural hoon. That’s hygiene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sequel_hook&quot;&gt;Sequel hook&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So is this the right way to write decrement (assuming we didn’t already have decrement)? No - there is actually a hoon designed specifically for building gates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The right code (which we saw earlier) is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=&amp;lt;  (deq a)
|%
++  deq
  |=  x=@
  =|  y=@
  |-  ?:  =(x +(y))
        y
      $(y +(y))
--
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this requires us to understand &lt;code&gt;x=@&lt;/code&gt; - which &lt;em&gt;isn’t even a twig&lt;/em&gt;. Rather, it’s something else, called a &lt;code&gt;tile&lt;/code&gt;. We’ll make friends with the tiles in the next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those with classic FP experience, it’s very tempting to read &lt;code&gt;|=&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;bartis&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%brts&lt;/code&gt;) as “lambda.” I hope it’s clear by now that the difference between Hoon and classic FP languages is like the difference between a bat and a bird. Both have wings and use them to fly, but below that level everything is different.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;urbit-is-easy-ch6.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prev&lt;/strong&gt;: Moar Hoon Types&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I’ve only been in love with a beer bottle and a mirror.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(Sid Vicious)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;syntax&quot;&gt;Syntax&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is Hoon actually an improvement on Nock? The jury holds out. Here is our old decrement function, from the Nock battery:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ 8
  [1 0]
  [ 8
    [ 1
      [ 6
        [5 [4 0 6] [0 30]]
        [0 6]
        [9 2 [0 2] [4 0 6] [0 7]]
      ]
    ]
    [9 2 0 1]
  ]
]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This clearly it is not for the little boys and girls. But wait - is Hoon any less formidable? The equivalent Hoon twig:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;|=  a=@
=|  b=@
|-  ?:  =(a +(b))
      b
    $(b +(b))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whaa? We can also write the exact same decrement as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;|=(a=@ =|(b=@ |-(?:(=(a +(b)) b $(b +(b))))))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for instance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; (|=(a=@ =|(b=@ |-(?:(=(a +(b)) b $(b +(b)))))) 42)
41&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or even more cryptically,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; %.(42 |=(a=@ =|(b=@ |-(?:(=(a +(b)) b $(b +(b)))))))
41&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I showed this to my daughter, who ran away in tears. Dear reader, I hope you’re not tempted to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoon actually is easy! It’s much easier than Nock. Nock really isn’t that hard itself, unless you want to do something useful with it. But to learn Hoon, you just have to accept that it’s really quite orthogonal to any or all of those &lt;em&gt;20th-century&lt;/em&gt; languages you knew already. Even the functional ones, mostly. If anything, this knowledge makes it harder to learn Hoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mutual hope is that by the time you do know Hoon, you will simply be able to &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; a twig like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;|=  a=@
=|  b=@
|-  ?:  =(a +(b))
      b
    $(b +(b))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and, far from merely able to follow this code, &lt;em&gt;actually observe in your mind’s eye the function itself&lt;/em&gt; - not unlike Keanu with kung fu. You will simply look at this strange collection of squiggles and &lt;em&gt;see decrement&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Our feeling is that the use of reserved words in most languages, by instead activating the verbal lobes, disrupts this sense of directly, or at least visually, perceiving the program itself. If you object that this sounds too much like Science, Science implies testing hypotheses whereas we generally just wing it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of learning Hoon as learning to program all over again. If nothing else, it’s a sort of eccentric adventure sport. Or even a mystery - can a language be esoteric, yet useful? Click here to find out more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;glyphs&quot;&gt;Glyphs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s actually worse than that - learning Hoon is learning to &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; all over again. Again, Hoon is a reserved-word-free language - any text in the program is part of the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use so many of these ASCII glyphs that we like to be able to read them out loud. A language is meant to be &lt;em&gt;said&lt;/em&gt;. The squiggles have conventional names, sort of, some of them easy to say, others not so much. So we’ve renamed them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ace  space      gal  &amp;lt;          per  )
bar  |          gar  &amp;gt;          sel  [
bas  \          hax  #          sem  ;
buc  $          hep  -          ser  ]
cab  _          kel  {          sig  ~
cen  %          ker  }          soq  &amp;#39;
col  :          ket  ^          tar  *
com  ,          lus  +          tec  `
doq  &amp;quot;          pam  &amp;amp;          tis  =
dot  .          pat  @          wut  ?
fas  /          pel  (          zap  !&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You just have to memorize these names. Sorry. We accept that they are vile, barbaric and loathsome. So is life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;runes&quot;&gt;Runes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But is this at least enough symbols? Alas, nowhere near. ASCII’s glyph supply is not the greatest, but we can make all the squiggles we need by forming digraphs, or &lt;em&gt;runes&lt;/em&gt;. For example: &lt;code&gt;bartis&lt;/code&gt;, ie, &lt;code&gt;|=&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To pronounce a rune, concatenate the glyph names, stressing the first syllable and softening the second vowel into a “schwa.” Hence, to say &lt;code&gt;~.&lt;/code&gt;, say “sigdot.” To say &lt;code&gt;|=&lt;/code&gt;, say “bartis.” Which has an inevitable tendency to turn into “barts” - a sin to be encouraged. In any language actually spoken by actual humans, benign indolence soon rounds off any rough edges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few runes with irregular special pronunciations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;--    hephep    phep    
+-    lushep    slep
++    luslus    slus
==    tistis    stet
+&amp;lt;    lusgal    glus
+&amp;gt;    lusgar    gras
-&amp;lt;    hepgal    gelp
-&amp;gt;    hepgar    garp     &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at that decrement twig again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;|=  a=@
=|  b=@
|-  ?:  =(a +(b))
      b
    $(b +(b))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we had to read this twig, omitting the spaces (which only a real purist would pronounce), we’d say: “bartis A is pat tisbar B is pat barhep wutcol tis pel A lus pel B perper B bucpel B luspel B perper.” The authorities would then arrive, and drag us out in a big net. Definitely don’t do this at the airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoon has almost 90 digraphic runes. Worse, “Hoon runes” are inevitably shortened to “hoons” - a ridiculous non-English word due originally to Wallace Stevens, which also has the unique property of reducing Australians to convulsions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this should scare you. First, 90 symbols is not a lot compared to, say, Chinese. Second, hoons are easier than you’d expect to organize in your head, because the choice of glyph is not random. Third, no one lives in Australia and nobody cares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second glyph in a hoon means little or nothing, but the first defines a rough semantic category. These categories are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;|  bar    core construction
$  buc    tiles and tiling
%  cen    invocations
:  col    tuples
.  dot    nock operators
^  ket    type conversions
;  sem    miscellaneous macros
~  sig    hints
=  tis    compositions
?  wut    conditionals, booleans, tests
!  zap    special operations&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;regular_forms&quot;&gt;Regular forms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like natural languages, Hoon wraps a blanket of funky, irregular, easy-to-type abbreviations around a comforting but verbose regular core. Let’s explain the regular core first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider a very simple twig in completely regular form:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;?:  &amp;amp;
  47
52&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We observe the rune &lt;code&gt;?:&lt;/code&gt;, which happens to mean the same thing it means in C. In C, though, we don’t call it &lt;code&gt;wutcol&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(In case you don’t remember from chapter 5, &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; just means &lt;code&gt;yes&lt;/code&gt;, ie, &lt;code&gt;@f&lt;/code&gt;0 in our loobean logic. (&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt; is 1.) So this twig just produces &lt;code&gt;47&lt;/code&gt;, not that it matters.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;%wutcol&lt;/code&gt; as a noun has a problem - it doesn’t fit in 32 bits. Efficiency is important to us, so we disemvowel: &lt;code&gt;%wtcl&lt;/code&gt;. We can find this defined in &lt;code&gt;hoon.hoon&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[%wtcl p=twig q=twig r=twig]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So &lt;code&gt;?:&lt;/code&gt; has three legs: the test, the yes case, and the no case. Again, as in C. But why do we write it in this strange triangular indentation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tall_forms&quot;&gt;Tall forms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When all is said and done, the programmer is formatting a big wall of text. This canvas has a curious but essential property - it is indefinitely tall, but finitely wide. We strongly encourage an 80-column standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the programmer’s task as a visual designer is to persuade her code to flow &lt;em&gt;down&lt;/em&gt;, not &lt;em&gt;across&lt;/em&gt;. The usual way to lay out a tree which does not fit on one line is to indent the subtrees and enclose them in parens, brackets or braces. Which might look like this (&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Hoon syntax):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;?:  {
  &amp;amp;
  47
  52
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoon, like other functional languages, has very deep expression trees. In this simple, classic syntax model, a functional language develops huge piles of closing parens at the end of large blocks, which is manageable but ugly. Less manageably, as each subtree is indented to the right, the width of the text window bounds the depth of the expression tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other languages skip the braces and parse whitespace, using indentation to express tree depth. This actually is valid (but ugly) Hoon:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;?:
  &amp;amp;
  47
  52&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gets rid of the terminator problem, but keeps the width problem. And parsing whitespace is horrible. Whitespace in Hoon is not significant, though its presence or absence is. (Note also that hard TAB characters are &lt;em&gt;zutiefst verboten&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoon notices a couple of things about this problem. First, most Hoon twigs have small constant fanout. A parser shouldn’t need either significant whitespace or a terminator to figure out how many twigs follow &lt;code&gt;?:&lt;/code&gt; - the answer is always 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, our goal is to descend into a deep tree without losing right margin. With the &lt;em&gt;backstep&lt;/em&gt; pattern&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;?:  &amp;amp;
  47
52&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;=+  a=3
b&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we step two spaces backward at each subtwig, till the last one is at the same indentation as its parent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This preserves your right margin in one and only one case - where the bottom twig is the heaviest. For example, if we write&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;?:  &amp;amp;
  47
?:  |
  52
?:  &amp;amp;
  97
=+  35
b&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we see a tree that flows neatly down the screen. It’s obviously much nicer than, say (&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Hoon syntax):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;?:  {
  &amp;amp;
  47
  ?:  {
    |
    52
    ?:  {
      &amp;amp;
      97
      =+  {
        35
        b
      }
    }
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or any similar abortion. But its downward flow depends on the coincidence of the bottom twig being the heavy one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;?:  &amp;amp;
  ?:  |
    52
  ?:  &amp;amp;
    97
  =+  35
  b
47&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To handle this, Hoon has a reasonable selection of reverse hoons, which have the same semantics but inverse order. For instance, if &lt;code&gt;?:&lt;/code&gt; is “if,” &lt;code&gt;?.&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;wutdot&lt;/code&gt;) is “unless”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;?.  &amp;amp;
  47
?:  |
  52
?:  &amp;amp;
  97
=+  35
b&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wide_forms&quot;&gt;Wide forms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observe that in the tall syntax, there are always at least &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; spaces (or one newline) between tokens. Other than this, nothing requires anything to be tall. For instance, it is normal and only slightly aggressive to write:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;?.  &amp;amp;  47
?:  |  52
?:  &amp;amp;  97
=+  35
b&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we could even go so far as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;?.  &amp;amp;  47  ?:  |  52  ?:  &amp;amp;  97  =+  35  b&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few would find this readable, which is why Hoon also has a &lt;em&gt;wide&lt;/em&gt; syntax:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;?.(&amp;amp; 47 ?:(| 52 ?:(&amp;amp; 97 =+(35 b))))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a single line, the parentheses - while a parser could get away with skipping them - are needed to actually read the expression. The hoon attaches directly to the left paren (&lt;code&gt;pel&lt;/code&gt;), and a double space or a newline is a syntax error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The semantics of tall and wide syntax are identical, of course. The choice is entirely up to the programmer. Some languages can be formatted automatically - turning an abstract syntax tree into a tall, handsome Hoon file is an art form. We won’t say a program could never do it - but it’d be work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wide forms are also nice because our immature and incomplete command-line shell can’t process multi-line input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;irregular_forms&quot;&gt;Irregular forms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a very large set of primitives, neither tall nor wide form is tight enough. If you go to &lt;code&gt;++scat&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;hoon.hoon&lt;/code&gt;, you can see them all, organized by initial character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the place to go over the irregular forms directly - we’ll introduce them when we talk about individual runes, or when we run into them and we can’t go around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;semantics&quot;&gt;Semantics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re finally ready to write our first Hoon program. But&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a_new_testbed&quot;&gt;A new testbed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we’re going to have to write multi-line Hoon programs, the command line is no longer enough. We’ll need another toy testbed, this one in &lt;code&gt;urb/waclux-tomwyc/try/bin/toy.hoon&lt;/code&gt;. Its text should be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;!:             ::  To write a trivial Hoon program
|=  *          ::
|=  [x=@ ~]    ::  For educational purposes only
:_  ~  :_  ~   ::
:-  %$         ::  Preserve this mysterious boilerplate square
!&amp;gt;             ::
:::::::::::::::::  Produce a value below
(add 2 x)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test that it works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :toy 3
5&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copy it into &lt;code&gt;try/bin/hec.hoon&lt;/code&gt;, where we’ll write our Hoon decrement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;+ /~waclux-tomwyc/try/7/bin/hec/hoon
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :hec 3
5&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replace &lt;code&gt;(add 2 x)&lt;/code&gt; with our decrement twig:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;%.  x
|=  a=@
=|  b=@
|-  ?:  =(a +(b))
      b
    $(b +(b))

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :hec 42
41&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works. But, why does it work? What are these twigs, anyway?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;twigs&quot;&gt;Twigs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have already defined the noble twig - in chapter 5. Let’s just &lt;em&gt;reprint&lt;/em&gt; that text - odds are you’ve forgotten it already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we parse a Hoon expression, file, etc, we produce what we call a &lt;code&gt;twig&lt;/code&gt;, which (if you know the CS jargon) is an AST. A twig is a noun that’s converted into a Nock formula, with the assistance of a type which describes the subject of the formula:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[subject-type twig] =&amp;gt; formula&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But actually this isn’t quite right, because Hoon does something called “type inference.” When we have a type that describes the subject for the formula we’re trying to generate, as we generate that formula we want to also generate a type for the product of that formula on that subject. So our compiler computes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[subject-type twig] =&amp;gt; [product-type formula]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as &lt;code&gt;subject-type&lt;/code&gt; is a correct description of some subject, you can take any twig and compile it against &lt;code&gt;subject-type&lt;/code&gt;, producing a &lt;code&gt;formula&lt;/code&gt; such that &lt;code&gt;*(subject
formula)&lt;/code&gt; is a product correctly described by &lt;code&gt;product-type&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, this works well enough that in Hoon there is no direct syntax for defining or declaring a type. There is only a syntax for constructing twigs. Types are exclusively formed by inference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;natural_and_synthetic_hoons&quot;&gt;Natural and synthetic hoons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, most kinds of hoons are &lt;em&gt;synthetic&lt;/em&gt; hoons - in a word, macros. Synthetic hoons evaluate by reducing to other twigs, eventually down to direct ones. Hoon could do without all its synthetic hoons, though it would be awfully cumbersome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, as we’ve seen with &lt;code&gt;?:&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;?.&lt;/code&gt;, when we compile &lt;code&gt;wutdot&lt;/code&gt; - &lt;code&gt;[%wtdt p q r]&lt;/code&gt; - we turn it into &lt;code&gt;[%wtcl p r q]&lt;/code&gt;. It’s all just syntactic sugar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, at the risk of scaring you further, here is the entire Hoon type-inference function from &lt;code&gt;hoon.hoon&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;++play&lt;/code&gt; is a serviceable list of the &lt;em&gt;natural&lt;/em&gt; hoons - the axioms, as it were. Understand all these, and the rest are just… macros.&lt;/p&gt;

                 ~|(%play-open !!)
               $(gen doz)
  ==&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it’s a little intimidating. But not bad for a whole language, perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by working through the hoons we’ll need to make decrement work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cores&quot;&gt;Cores&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build decrement, we’ll need a loop. To write a loop, we’ll need a core. This adds another to the kinds of types we know:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;++  type  $|  ?(%noun %void)                            ::
          $%  [%atom p=term]                            ::
              [%cell p=type q=type]                     ::
              [%core p=type q=coil]                     ::
              [%cube p=* q=type]                        ::
              [%face p=term q=type]                     ::
              [%fork p=type q=type]                     ::
              [%hold p=(list ,[p=type q=twig])]         ::
          ==                                            ::
++  coil  $:  p=?(%gold %iron %lead %zinc)              ::
              q=type                                    ::
              r=[p=?(~ ^) q=(map term foot)]            ::
          ==                                            ::
++  foot  $%  [%ash p=twig]                             ::
              [%elm p=twig]                             ::
          ==                                            ::&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aha, you say. I knew there had to be something complicated in here. Well, fact is, I’m just a simple country mouse and so are you, but Hoon is a polymorphic higher-order typed functional language with genericity and stuff, and you don’t get that without a little bit of urban funk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we want to keep it simple for now, so let’s imagine it said&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[%core p=type q=(map term twig)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we recall from chapter 4, a core is a &lt;code&gt;[code data]&lt;/code&gt; cell - &lt;code&gt;[battery payload]&lt;/code&gt;. Essentially, an object. The battery, at the Nock level, is a tree of formulas, each of whose subject is the core itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s change our test file to produce a core. The whole file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
!:             ::  To write a trivial Hoon program
|=  *          ::
|=  [a=@ ~]    ::  For educational purposes only
:_  ~  :_  ~   ::
:-  %$         ::  Preserve this mysterious boilerplate square
!&amp;gt;             ::
:::::::::::::::::  Produce a value below
|%
++  hello
  &amp;quot;hello, world.&amp;quot;
--
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The syntax for a basic core is &lt;code&gt;|%&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;barcen&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;%brcn&lt;/code&gt;), followed by any number of arms &lt;code&gt;++&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;luslus&lt;/code&gt;, or just &lt;code&gt;slus&lt;/code&gt;), followed by a terminator &lt;code&gt;--&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;hephep&lt;/code&gt;, or just &lt;code&gt;phep&lt;/code&gt;). The arm is a symbol and a twig. The subject of the twig is the core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s try this puppy out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;: /~waclux-tomwyc/try/9/bin/hec/hoon
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :hec
! type-fail
! exit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoops! We forgot that Arvo is a &lt;em&gt;typed&lt;/em&gt; command-line. Because it’s parsed as an open-ended list, it always has the terminator (&lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;, which is just &lt;code&gt;@n&lt;/code&gt;0) on the end. But it needs an atom:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;|=  [a=@ ~]    ::  For educational purposes only&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :hec 42
&amp;lt; 1.ivl
  1.hfd
  [ [a=@ %~]
    &amp;lt;1.vpy [* [@p /] &amp;lt;218.tvj 18.olk 323.uvl 81.wza 1.xlc %164&amp;gt;]&amp;gt;
  ]
&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a core. Or it’s how we print a core, anyway. This is actually a giant noun full of all kinds of formulas, and it would be kind of lame to dump a megabyte of nock on your screen. The print format is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;number-of-arms.checksum payload&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we wrapped our new &lt;code&gt;1.ivl&lt;/code&gt; core, with its &lt;code&gt;++hello&lt;/code&gt; arm, around the &lt;code&gt;1.hfd&lt;/code&gt; core (which is the &lt;code&gt;|=  [a=@ ~]&lt;/code&gt; thingy), around a stack of cores ultimately terminating in the giant kernel with hundreds of arms (like &lt;code&gt;218.tvj&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay. But we built a core because we wanted to use it. So, let’s do that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=&amp;gt;  |%
    ++  hello
      &amp;quot;hello, world.&amp;quot;
    --
hello
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is this &lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;tisgar&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%tsgr&lt;/code&gt;? You remember Nock 7. &lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is Nock 7. &lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt;(a b)&lt;/code&gt; means “use a as the subject of b.” So, we are resolving the limb &lt;code&gt;hello&lt;/code&gt; against our &lt;code&gt;1.ivl&lt;/code&gt; core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when we try it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;: /~waclux-tomwyc/try/11/bin/hec/hoon
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :hec 42
&amp;quot;hello, world.&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s observe a couple of things. First, an arm is not a method in the OO sense. You don’t see any arguments on &lt;code&gt;++hello&lt;/code&gt;. Rather, the arm is a computed expression - a synthetic attribute, as it were. (Can we build a method? We’ll get to that.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, when we’re searching for a name in a core, we search the payload if we don’t find an arm. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=&amp;gt;  |%
    ++  hello
      &amp;quot;hello, world.&amp;quot;
    --
a

: /~waclux-tomwyc/try/12/bin/hec/hoon
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :hec 42
42
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our command-line argument, &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, is still in there. We can also use it from within the arm. With some string-interpolation black magic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=&amp;gt;  |%
    ++  hello
      &amp;quot;hello, world - a is { (scow %ud a) }.&amp;quot;
    --
hello

: /~waclux-tomwyc/try/13/bin/hec/hoon
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :hec 42
&amp;quot;hello, world - a is 42.&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, this is a classic case in which the twig needs to be reversed to make it flow downward. We need the opposite of &lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;=&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;tisgal&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%tsgl&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=&amp;lt;  hello
|%
++  hello
  &amp;quot;hello, world - a is { (scow %ud a) }.&amp;quot;
--

: /~waclux-tomwyc/try/14/bin/hec/hoon
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :hec 42
&amp;quot;hello, world - a is 42.&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;preparing_to_decrement&quot;&gt;Preparing to decrement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do some decrementing, we’ll need a counter. Let’s continue our pattern of using only natural hoons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=&amp;gt;  :-  ^=  b
        0
    .
=&amp;lt;  decrement
|%
++  decrement
  b
--

: /~waclux-tomwyc/try/16/bin/hec/hoon
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :hec 42
0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We introduce a couple of new hoons. First, &lt;code&gt;^=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;kettis&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%ktts&lt;/code&gt; - is a hoon we’ve already seen. We’ve seen it only in its irregular form - not &lt;code&gt;^=(b 0)&lt;/code&gt;, but, of course, &lt;code&gt;b=0&lt;/code&gt;. (Pronounced not “b tis zero,” but, of course, “b is zero.”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve also seen &lt;code&gt;:-&lt;/code&gt; in its irregular form - it just makes a cell. &lt;code&gt;:-(a b)&lt;/code&gt; is just &lt;code&gt;[a b]&lt;/code&gt;. We have a set of these hoons, which let us build cells in classic Hoon fashion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;:-(a b)       [a b]
:+(a b c)     [a b c]
:^(a b c d)   [a b c d]
:_(a b)       [b a]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we might as well say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=&amp;gt;  [b=0 .]
=&amp;lt;  decrement
|%
++  decrement
  b
--
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words - enter our core not with the original subject, &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;, but with the cell &lt;code&gt;[b=0 .]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might remember this as nock &lt;code&gt;8&lt;/code&gt; - and in fact (it is a synthetic hoon, but the compiler sees what you’re doing and turns it into nock &lt;code&gt;8&lt;/code&gt; anyway) there’s a hoon for that: &lt;code&gt;=+&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;tislus&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%tsls&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=+  b=0
=&amp;lt;  decrement
|%
++  decrement
  b
--
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;actually_decrementing&quot;&gt;Actually decrementing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may remember, to decrement &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; we need to count up to it. The first step is incrementing, which we do with &lt;code&gt;.+&lt;/code&gt; - &lt;code&gt;dotlus&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%dtls&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=+  b=0
=&amp;lt;  decrement
|%
++  decrement
  .+(b)
--

: /~waclux-tomwyc/try/19/bin/hec/hoon
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :hec 42
1
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it’s not decrement but it’s a start. What we really have to do is see if &lt;code&gt;+(b)&lt;/code&gt; equals &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=+  b=0
=&amp;lt;  decrement
|%
++  decrement
  ?:  .=(a +(b))
    b
  99
--
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve met a new hoon, &lt;code&gt;.=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;dottis&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%dtts&lt;/code&gt;. It too has an irregular form, not surprisingly different:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=+  b=0
=&amp;lt;  decrement
|%
++  decrement
  ?:  =(a +(b))
    b
  99
--
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And &lt;code&gt;?:&lt;/code&gt; was of course one of our first examples. We can test this, for what it’s worth:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :hec 42
99
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :hec 1
0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it works. For one case of “works.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, gosh, instead of &lt;code&gt;99&lt;/code&gt; - which is obviously just wrong - what we’d actually like to do is, if &lt;code&gt;+(b)&lt;/code&gt; isn’t equal to &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, compute &lt;code&gt;decrement&lt;/code&gt; again, but with &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; set to &lt;code&gt;+(b)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a way to do that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=+  b=0
=&amp;lt;  decrement
|%
++  decrement
  ?:  =(a +(b))
    b
  %=  decrement
      b  +(b)
  ==
--
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meet &lt;code&gt;%=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;centis&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%cnts&lt;/code&gt; - the world’s most important hoon. Actually, &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; that references a limb/wing turns into &lt;code&gt;%=&lt;/code&gt;. Let’s look at its definition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;++  twig  $%  [%cnts p=wing q=tray]
          ==
++  tray  (list ,[p=wing q=twig])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;%=&lt;/code&gt; means “resolve with changes.” If &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; is empty, &lt;code&gt;%=&lt;/code&gt; just pulls wing &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; with no changes. Otherwise, we get &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; with the wings in &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; set to the provided twigs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A wing, of course, can resolve to a leg or an arm - a fragment of the subject, or a computed attribute like &lt;code&gt;++decrement&lt;/code&gt; above. When &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; resolves to an arm, we compute based on the changes defined in &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt;. (When one of the wings in &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; resolves to an arm, the change is to the core that contains the arm.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this should do exactly what we want - it should replace &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;+(b)&lt;/code&gt;, and recompute. But does it? Amazingly&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;: /~waclux-tomwyc/try/21/bin/hec/hoon

41&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;making_it_pretty&quot;&gt;Making it pretty&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing we notice is that &lt;code&gt;%=&lt;/code&gt; is pretty important, and being pretty important it ought to have an irregular form:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=+  b=0
=&amp;lt;  decrement
|%
++  decrement
  ?:  =(a +(b))
    b
  decrement(b +(b))
--
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second thing we notice is this heavy word, &lt;code&gt;decrement&lt;/code&gt;, which we are dragging around everywhere. Actually, we know we’re writing a decrement program. So why do we keep saying decrement, decrement, decrement?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naming things is one of the most annoying and difficult problems in programming. Nobody should have to name anything, especially if its only job is to call itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, a unique feature of Hoon is &lt;em&gt;the empty name&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;. The character (the dollar sign) is pronounced &lt;code&gt;buc&lt;/code&gt;; the value; (the empty term) is pronounced &lt;code&gt;blip&lt;/code&gt;. So you can say either. Or both - depends if you’re money. Either way, neighbor, &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; has a value and it ain’t nothing but zero:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ux`%foo
0x6f.6f66
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ux`%$
0x0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we use &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; as a name, our decrement gets cleaner - or shorter, anyway:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=+  b=0
=&amp;lt;  $
|%
++  $
  ?:  =(a +(b))
    b
  $(b +(b))
--
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third thing we notice is that this pattern of “have one arm and do it again with some changes” is… well, it has a name. So we might expect to see a more convenient hoon - and indeed we do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;=+  b=0
=&amp;lt;  $
|.
?:  =(a +(b))
  b
$(b +(b))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is &lt;code&gt;|.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;bardot&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%brdt&lt;/code&gt;? It’s easy to see what a synthetic hoon does - we just look at its line in &lt;code&gt;++open&lt;/code&gt; (in &lt;code&gt;hoon.hoon&lt;/code&gt;). For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[%tsgl *]  [%tsgr q.gen p.gen]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and, more to the point:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[%brdt *]  [%brcn (~(put by *(map term foot)) %$ [%ash p.gen])]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Okay, this isn’t exactly as pellucid as it might be. All it means is that we create a &lt;code&gt;|%&lt;/code&gt; with one arm, our &lt;code&gt;%$&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, it seems like we might want to activate one of these strange repeating computations automagically. Indeed there’s a hoon for that - &lt;code&gt;|-&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;barhep&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%brhp&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[%brhp *]  [%tsgl [%cnzy %$] [%brdt p.gen]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that we just did that. &lt;code&gt;%cnzy&lt;/code&gt; is an internal hoon which doesn’t have a syntax, and just makes macros smaller:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[%cnzy *]  [%cnts [p.gen ~] ~]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aha, good old &lt;code&gt;%cnts&lt;/code&gt; - aka, &lt;code&gt;%=&lt;/code&gt;. But wait - does it work? We get:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;=+  b=0
|-
?:  =(a +(b))
  b
$(b +(b))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, to indent this a little more aggressively, our final result. It isn’t exactly what we started with - but we’ll get there in a minute:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;!:             ::  To write a trivial Hoon program
|=  *          ::
|=  [a=@ ~]    ::  For educational purposes only
:_  ~  :_  ~   ::
:-  %$         ::  Preserve this mysterious boilerplate square
!&amp;gt;             ::
:::::::::::::::::  Produce a value below
=+  b=0
|-  ?:  =(a +(b))
      b
    $(b +(b))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s try it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;: /~waclux-tomwyc/try/22/bin/hec/hoon
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :hec 42
41&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;exercises&quot;&gt;Exercises&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercise 1: write the entire expression under the boilerplate above, in one line as wide form. Test it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercise 2: write a Hoon program :fib that instead computes the Fibonacci number at &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;urbit-is-easy-ch5.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prev&lt;/strong&gt;: Intro To Hoon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;urbit-is-easy-ch7.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt;: Hoon Computes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What good is a phone call if you’re unable to speak?”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(The Matrix)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;more_simple_types&quot;&gt;More simple types&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we actually do some programming with Hoon, let’s meet two more kinds of type - &lt;code&gt;%face&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;%fork&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;++  type  $|  ?(%noun %void)
          $%  [%atom p=term]
              [%cell p=type q=type]
              [%cube p=* q=type]  
              [%face p=term q=type]
              [%fork p=type q=type]
          ==&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;%fork&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;%fork&lt;/code&gt; is simply a union type. A type is a set of nouns - &lt;code&gt;[%fork p q]&lt;/code&gt; means “it could be a p, or maybe a q.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any branching computation in which different branches produce different types will generate a fork. For example, without worrying too much about the mysterious &lt;code&gt;?:&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; ?:(&amp;amp; %foo [13 10])
%foo
{ %foo [@ud @ud] }

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -:!&amp;gt;(?:(&amp;amp; %foo [13 10]))
[ %fork
  p=[%cube p=7.303.014 q=[%atom p=%tas]]
  q=[%cell p=[%atom p=%ud] q=[%atom p=%ud]]
]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we start to understand why the type renderer is useful, as &lt;code&gt;{ %foo [@ud @ud] }&lt;/code&gt; (which is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in any way Hoon syntax) is a little easier to read than the actual type noun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Readers of a mathematical bent may ask: since Hoon has a union type, where is the intersection type? There is none. Hoon is not one of these languages whose goal is to be as mathematically powerful as possible. Since a programming language is a UI for programmers, and programmers are not mathematicians, Hoon is designed to be as powerful as it has to be - and no more.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;_2&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;%face&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A type is not just a set of nouns - it’s also a &lt;em&gt;meaning&lt;/em&gt; which makes sense of any noun in that set. The typed noun exports a namespace - give it a name, and it gives you another noun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s use this feature:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; foo=42
foo=42
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; foo=42
foo=42
foo=@ud
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -:!&amp;gt;(foo=42)
[%face p=%foo q=[%atom p=%ud]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With &lt;code&gt;%face&lt;/code&gt;, we’ve simply wrapped a label around another type. Note that this doesn’t impair our ability to compute with the value. Computationally, &lt;code&gt;foo=42&lt;/code&gt; is just &lt;code&gt;42&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; (add 17 foo=42)
59&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how do we use this namespace?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To play comfortably with names, it’ll help if we introduce some Arvo shell syntax. As in Unix, you can bind variables in the Arvo shell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; =test 42
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; test
42
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; (add 17 test)
59&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;code&gt;=name value&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in any way Hoon syntax - any Hoon expression is a valid Arvo command, but not every Arvo command is a Hoon expression.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s put a &lt;code&gt;%face&lt;/code&gt; inside this shell variable and try to use it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; =test foo=42
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; test
foo=42
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; foo.test
42&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably expected it to be &lt;code&gt;test.foo&lt;/code&gt;. This disoriented feeling should vanish in a few minutes. Let’s go further:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; =test foo=42
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; test
foo=42
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; foo.test
42

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; =test bar=foo=42
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; test
bar=foo=42
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -:!&amp;gt;(test)
[%face p=%bar q=[%face p=%foo q=[%atom p=%ud]]]

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; bar.test
foo=42
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -:!&amp;gt;(bar.test)
[%face p=%foo q=[%atom p=%ud]]

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; foo.bar.test
42
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -:!&amp;gt;(foo.bar.test)
[%atom p=%ud]

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; foo.test
! -find-limb.foo
! find-none
! exit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;name_resolution&quot;&gt;Name resolution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re starting to learn a little about name resolution in Hoon. We’ve seen that &lt;code&gt;foo.bar.test&lt;/code&gt; means “foo in bar in test.” We’ve seen that faces have to be unwrapped a layer at a time, so “foo in test” is an error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s try some cells:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; =test [cat=3 dog=4]
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; cat.test
3
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; =test [cat=3 dog=[pig=9 rat=12]]
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; rat.dog.test
12&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see that name resolution seeks into cells. This solves one of the problems we had when programming in Nock. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; =test [cow=97 test]
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; cow.test
97
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; rat.dog.test
12&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By replacing &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;[cow=97 test]&lt;/code&gt;, we’ve done exactly the same thing as nock &lt;code&gt;8&lt;/code&gt;. (And we’ll do more of it.) Note that because we didn’t wrap a face around &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt;, we seek into it when looking for &lt;code&gt;dog&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;rat.dog.test&lt;/code&gt; works just the same way. Even though &lt;code&gt;dog&lt;/code&gt; is now at a different axis within &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For reasons we’ll see soon, we often want empty names. As we saw before, the syntax for an empty name is &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; =test $=42
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; $.test
42&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And interesting cases tell us more about the search algorithm:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; =test [cat=3 cat=[pig=9 rat=12]]
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; cat.test
3
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; pig.cat.test
! -find-limb.pig
! find-none
! exit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see that when we search a cell, we search the head first. It is not in any way an error to have two faces with the same name. And in fact, we can even work with this constraint:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; ^cat.test
[pig=9 rat=12]
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; pig.^cat.test
9&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;limb&lt;/code&gt; to resolve is not just a name - it takes a prefix which is an arbitrary number of &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt; characters. This count is the number of name instances to ignore before matching. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; =test [cat=3 cat=[pig=9 rat=12] cat=42]
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; ^^cat.test
42&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re actually ready to describe the full resolution model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wing_resolution&quot;&gt;Wing resolution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;wing&lt;/code&gt; is a dot-separated list, reading outside to in from right to left. Each element is a &lt;code&gt;limb&lt;/code&gt;. We’ve seen one kind of limb - the name, with &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt; prefixes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we can also use axes directly from Hoon. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; =test [cat=3 dog=[pig=9 rat=12]]
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; +3.test
dog=[pig=9 rat=12]
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; dog.test
[pig=9 rat=12]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the difference between these two. The noun is the same - they are both &lt;code&gt;[9 12]&lt;/code&gt;. But the type is different:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -:!&amp;gt;(+3.test)
[ %face
  p=%dog
    q
  [ %cell
    p=[%face p=%pig q=[%atom p=%ud]]
    q=[%face p=%rat q=[%atom p=%ud]]
  ]
]

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -:!&amp;gt;(dog.test)
[ %cell
  p=[%face p=%pig q=[%atom p=%ud]]
  q=[%face p=%rat q=[%atom p=%ud]]
]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The axis gets us to the %dog face; the name actually removes it. So we can write&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; pig.dog.+3.test
9
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; pig.dog.test
9
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; pig.+3.test
! -find-limb.pig
! find-none
! exit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is obvious. Perhaps it’s not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;axis_syntax&quot;&gt;Axis syntax&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may seem like overkill. Perhaps it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; overkill. But Hoon has five syntaxes for an axis limb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first we’ve seen already: the axis itself as a decimal, eg, &lt;code&gt;+3&lt;/code&gt;. The second is a simple dot, meaning &lt;code&gt;+1&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; =test 42
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; ..test
42&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, that’s the limb &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;, as applied (with &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;), to &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt;. Have we gone crazy? Perhaps - but in fact, this one gets used a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we have an list-indexing syntax for constant offsets in lists that (as is the Hoon convention) flow to the right. Indices start at 1. &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; produces the list element, &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt; produces the suffix:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; =test [1 2 3 4 ~]
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; &amp;amp;2.test
2
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; |2.test
[3 4 ~]
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; &amp;amp;1.test
1
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; |1.test
[2 3 4 ~]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mechanism - which essentially just converts the list index into an axis for &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; - is not used much, but nice when needed. It applies only to constant indices, though, which is odd. (For non-constant indices, use the Hoon function &lt;code&gt;snag&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have a graphical binary syntax which reads from left to right, alternating the pairs &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to mean head and tail respectively. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; =test [[[8 9] [10 11]] [12 13] 14 30 31]
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -.test
[[8 9] 10 11]
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; +.test
[[12 13] 14 30 31]
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -&amp;lt;.test
[8 9]
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; +&amp;gt;.test
[14 30 31]
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; +&amp;gt;-.test
14
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -&amp;gt;-.test
10
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; +&amp;gt;+&amp;lt;.test
30&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alternating glyphs create pleasant graphical patterns which are moderately memorable when used in moderation. Of course, in general, when we have names we should use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;resolving_forks&quot;&gt;Resolving forks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens when we resolve a name in a fork? Yikes. The general principle is that name resolution across a fork works if, and only if, the names resolve to the same axis on both branches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; =test ?:(&amp;amp; [pig=3 dog=4] [pig=%pig dog=%dog cat=%cat])
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -:!&amp;gt;(test)
[ %fork
    p
  [ %cell
    p=[%face p=%pig q=[%atom p=%ud]]
    q=[%face p=%dog q=[%atom p=%ud]]
  ]
    q
  [ %cell
    p=[%face p=%pig q=[%cube p=6.777.200 q=[%atom p=%tas]]]
      q
    [ %cell
      p=[%face p=%dog q=[%cube p=6.778.724 q=[%atom p=%tas]]]
      q=[%face p=%cat q=[%cube p=7.627.107 q=[%atom p=%tas]]]
    ]
  ]
]
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; pig.test
3
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -:!&amp;gt;(pig.test)
[%fork p=[%atom p=%ud] q=[%cube p=6.777.200 q=[%atom p=%tas]]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; dog.test
! -find-limb.dog
! find-fork
! exit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Because &lt;code&gt;dog&lt;/code&gt; is at &lt;code&gt;+3&lt;/code&gt; on one side of the fork, &lt;code&gt;+6&lt;/code&gt; on the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve left only one major kind of type undefined - the mysterious, frightening &lt;code&gt;%core&lt;/code&gt;. We made a core in Nock, but that was a little while ago. We’ll explain them in Hoon when we make one.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;urbit-is-easy-ch4.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prev&lt;/strong&gt;: Using Nock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;urbit-is-easy-ch6.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt;: Moar Hoon Types&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Like all men in Babylon, I have been proconsul; like all, a slave.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(The Lottery in Babylon)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;principles_of_type&quot;&gt;Principles of type&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By working through the Nock tutorial, you’ve actually come closer than you know to knowing Hoon. Hoon is actually not much more than a fancy wrapper around Nock. People who know C can think of Hoon as the C to Urbit’s Nock - just a sprinkling of syntax, wrapped around machine code and memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, it’s easy to imagine how instead of calculating tree axes by hand, we could actually assign &lt;em&gt;names&lt;/em&gt; to different parts of the tree - and those names would stay the same as we pushed more data on the subject. It can’t hurt to dream, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way we’re going to do this is by associating something called a &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; with the subject. You may have heard of types before. Technically, Hoon is a statically typed language, which just means that the type isn’t a part of your program: it’s just a piece of data the compiler keeps around as it turns your Hoon into Nock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some languages, especially functional languages, types are dangerous scary concepts that involve a lot of math. For those who like this sort of thing, that’s the sort of thing they like. For the rest of us, there’s Hoon. It’s a functional language, but not one of those scary ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of other languages use dynamic types, in which the type of a value is carried along with the data as you use it. Even languages like Lisp, which are nominally typeless, look rather typed from the Hoon perspective. For example, a Lisp atom knows dynamically whether it’s a symbol or an integer. A Hoon atom is just a Nock atom, which is just a number. So without a static type, Hoon doesn’t even know how to print an atom properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we parse a Hoon expression, file, etc, we produce what we call a &lt;code&gt;twig&lt;/code&gt;, which (if you know the CS jargon) is an AST. A twig is a noun that’s converted into a Nock formula, with the assistance of a type which describes the subject of the formula:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[subject-type twig] =&amp;gt; formula&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But actually this isn’t quite right, because Hoon does something called “type inference.” When we have a type that describes the subject for the formula we’re trying to generate, as we generate that formula we want to also generate a type for the product of that formula on that subject. So our compiler computes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[subject-type twig] =&amp;gt; [product-type formula]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as &lt;code&gt;subject-type&lt;/code&gt; is a correct description of some subject, you can take any twig and compile it against &lt;code&gt;subject-type&lt;/code&gt;, producing a &lt;code&gt;formula&lt;/code&gt; such that &lt;code&gt;*(subject
formula)&lt;/code&gt; is a product correctly described by &lt;code&gt;product-type&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, this works well enough that in Hoon there is no direct syntax for defining or declaring a type. There is only a syntax for constructing twigs. Types are always produced by inference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;printing_types&quot;&gt;Printing types&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start looking at types with the simplest possible kind of hoon - an atomic constant, which ignores the subject and its type, and just produces its own subject. Here’s everyone’s favorite atomic constant:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; 42
42&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s also print its type - in two different ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; 42
42
@ud

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -:!&amp;gt;(42)
[%atom p=&amp;#39;ud&amp;#39;]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;W-what? Since types are of course static, printing them out dynamically involves a little bit of black magic at the Hoon and/or Arvo levels. All will be revealed in due course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a type, like everything else in Hoon, is a noun. Suffice it to say that &lt;code&gt;-:!&amp;gt;(42)&lt;/code&gt; is just printing this noun, whereas &lt;code&gt;:type; 42&lt;/code&gt; is rendering it intelligently as a string. In this case, the rendering is actually Hoon syntax, but in general it’s just a string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, looking directly at the type noun is preferable. But for a core, the type actually contains the entire codebase. For example, if you type&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -:!&amp;gt;(&amp;quot;string&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you’ll have to press ^C to rescue yourself, or wait until you’ve printed out more or less the entire Arvo kernel. Black magic is evil magic - it must exact its evil price. But someday, you’ll be more the sorcerer and less his apprentice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;atom_examples&quot;&gt;Atom examples&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at some more of these atoms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; 0x42
0x42
@ux

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; &amp;#39;foo&amp;#39;
&amp;#39;foo&amp;#39;
@ta

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; ~2013.12.6
~2013.12.6
@da

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; .127.0.0.1
.127.0.0.1
@if

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; ~m45
~m45
@dr

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; `@da`(add ~2013.12.6 ~m45)
~2013.12.6..00.45.00
@da&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, we got a little out of control with that last one. But the point should be clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note again that there is no dynamic type here. All these values are atoms. Let’s cast them all to decimals to see (don’t worry about the cast syntax - we’ll cover that later):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ud`0x42
66
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ud`&amp;#39;foo&amp;#39;
7.303.014
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ud`.127.0.0.1
2.130.706.433
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ud`~2013.12.6
170.141.184.500.724.667.905.957.736.036.171.776.000
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ud`~m45
49.806.208.999.015.789.363.200&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Yes, 45 minutes is actually quite a large number when your unit of time is 2^-64 seconds.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are these atoms, anyway? Let’s look at the actual type noun (which, without magic, exists only at compile time):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -:!&amp;gt;(42)
[%atom p=&amp;#39;ud&amp;#39;]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; is called the &lt;code&gt;odor&lt;/code&gt; of the atom. In this case, it’s &lt;code&gt;&amp;#39;ud&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;, ie, unsigned decimal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ud`&amp;#39;ud&amp;#39;
25.717&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s an unsigned-decimal interpretation of the atom ‘ud’, which without a cast is an atom of odor &lt;code&gt;@ta&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; &amp;#39;ud&amp;#39;
&amp;#39;ud&amp;#39;
@ta

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -:!&amp;gt;(&amp;#39;ud&amp;#39;)
[%atom p=&amp;#39;ta&amp;#39;]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case this is at all mysterious, we note:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; (add &amp;#39;u&amp;#39; (mul 256 &amp;#39;d&amp;#39;))
25.717&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a general convention, when we represent UTF-8/ASCII text as an atom, we store it LSB first. A text atom is generally called a &lt;code&gt;cord&lt;/code&gt;; if it is ASCII only, a &lt;code&gt;span&lt;/code&gt;; if it is ASCII restricted to the Hoon symbol subset (lowercase with hyphens), a &lt;code&gt;term&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the_logic_of_smell&quot;&gt;The logic of smell&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is an odor, anyway? We’ve seen that the type of an atom constant gets an odor which is a function of its syntax. We’ve also seen that when we print atoms on the console, the printer is (in some black-magic way) aware of the odor, and can print the atom in roughly the same syntax we originally entered it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoon’s type system is generally strong, but odors are weak. The parser itself will only generate a &lt;code&gt;@ta&lt;/code&gt; for an actual ASCII span, but not every atom is a constant. For instance, consider our construction of &lt;code&gt;&amp;#39;ud&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;. Let’s look at the type:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; &amp;#39;u&amp;#39;
&amp;#39;u&amp;#39;
@ta

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; 256 
256
@ud

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; (add &amp;#39;u&amp;#39; (mul 256 &amp;#39;d&amp;#39;))
25.717
@&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only are we mixing atoms of different odors in our arithmetic, but the result appears to be odorless. It is odorless. But we can cast it back:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; `@ta`(add &amp;#39;u&amp;#39; (mul 256 &amp;#39;d&amp;#39;))
&amp;#39;ud&amp;#39;
@ta&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Hoon’s type system is quite intelligent in some ways, it is by no means smart enough to evaluate your arithmetic and conclude that it produces a valid ASCII span. We can convert any atom to any other odor of atom, without any sanity checks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@dr`25.717
~.s0..0000.0000.0000.6475

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@if`25.717
.0.0.100.117&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It so happens that &lt;code&gt;25.717&lt;/code&gt; is a valid amount of time, and also a valid IPv4 address. But obviously not all atoms are meaningful values of every odor. We’re not going to annoy you by stressing out the console printer with bad ASCII, but we could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(And why do we say &lt;code&gt;25.717&lt;/code&gt; rather than &lt;code&gt;25,717&lt;/code&gt;? Are we Germans? No, but we want all atom syntaxes to be URL-safe. See below.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Odors are a weak type system because the programmer often knows, at a logical level not at all available to the type system, that (for example) &lt;code&gt;(add &amp;#39;u&amp;#39; (mul 256 &amp;#39;d&amp;#39;))&lt;/code&gt; produces an ASCII span. We want to keep the programmer from accidentally using a date as if it were text, but we don’t want to keep her from intentionally converting between odors or ascribing odor to the result of an arbitrary computation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An odor is exactly what it looks like - an ASCII span. This span is a taxonomy which grows more specific to the right. For instance, &lt;code&gt;@t&lt;/code&gt; for UTF-8 text, &lt;code&gt;@ta&lt;/code&gt; for URL-safe ASCII text, &lt;code&gt;@tas&lt;/code&gt; for a Hoon symbol; or &lt;code&gt;@u&lt;/code&gt; for an unsigned integer, &lt;code&gt;@ux&lt;/code&gt; for an unsigned integer formatted as hexadecimal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general principle of type enforcement is that atoms change freely either up or down the taxonomy, but not across. For instance, you can treat a &lt;code&gt;@tas&lt;/code&gt; as a &lt;code&gt;@t&lt;/code&gt;, as in a strong type system; but you can also treat a &lt;code&gt;@t&lt;/code&gt; as a &lt;code&gt;@tas&lt;/code&gt;, or an &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; as anything. However, passing a &lt;code&gt;@t&lt;/code&gt; to a function that expects an &lt;code&gt;@ux&lt;/code&gt; is a type error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the ability to cast a &lt;code&gt;@ud&lt;/code&gt; to a &lt;code&gt;@dr&lt;/code&gt; is a syntactic hack; casts in Hoon do not evade type enforcement. When you write&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;`@dr`25.717&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the parser actually produces the equivalent of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;`@dr``@`25.717&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;because we can’t turn &lt;code&gt;@ud&lt;/code&gt; directly into &lt;code&gt;@dr&lt;/code&gt;, but we can turn &lt;code&gt;@ud&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;@dr&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the_smell_of_size&quot;&gt;The smell of size&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides these prefixes, which indicate the rendering and/or meaning of atoms, the odor system has another orthogonal mechanism to restrict the size of atoms. Like the prefix, this mechanism is weak - it is not enforced and trivially evaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An odor span contains two parts, both optional: a lowercase prefix and an uppercase suffix. The suffix, if present, is a single character A-Z &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; which indicates an atom of size less than or equal to &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; bits, where &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (c - &amp;#39;A&amp;#39;)&lt;/code&gt;. Thus, &lt;code&gt;@tD&lt;/code&gt; is one UTF-8 byte (whatever that means); &lt;code&gt;@tN&lt;/code&gt; is a kilobyte or less of UTF-8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(It’s easy to complain from a standards perspective that “UTF-8” defines a format for bytestreams, not bytes, and at a strict level it means no more to say “one UTF-8 byte” than to say, say, “one GIF byte.” But odors are not a strict type system. It is possible for a byte to &lt;em&gt;smell&lt;/em&gt; of UTF-8 - or even of GIF.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When enforcing conversions, &lt;code&gt;@t&lt;/code&gt; has no size information and can be used as &lt;code&gt;@tD&lt;/code&gt;; and &lt;code&gt;@tD&lt;/code&gt;, of course, can be used as &lt;code&gt;@t&lt;/code&gt;. But using &lt;code&gt;@tN&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;@tD&lt;/code&gt; is an error. There is no way to generate the smell of size from a constant without a cast. And of course arithmetic results have no odor at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the utility of this mechanism is debatable, at worst it serves as a comment which documents the programmer’s intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A full table - for convenience, not because you’re stupid:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;A   1 bit
B   2 bits
C   4 bits
D   1 byte
E   2 bytes
F   4 bytes
G   8 bytes
H   16 bytes
I   32 bytes
J   64 bytes
K   128 bytes
L   256 bytes
M   512 bytes
N   1K
O   2K
P   4K
Q   8K
R   16K
S   32K
T   64K
U   128K
V   256K
W   512K
X   1MB
Y   2MB
Z   4MB&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You of course can build an atom larger than 4MB, though whether you should is another question entirely. But the type system cannot express a size odor above 4MB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;known_and_unknown_odors&quot;&gt;Known and unknown odors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The variety of units and formats which an atom can represent is essentially infinite. The set of syntaxes which Hoon can parse and print is fundamentally limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, Hoon has no syntax which means “number of miles.” But within your program, nothing stops you from using the odor system to distinguish a number of miles from, for instance, a number of kilometers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@udm`25.717
25.717
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@udk`25.717
25.717&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The printer has no idea what a &lt;code&gt;@udm&lt;/code&gt; is, but it knows what a &lt;code&gt;@ud&lt;/code&gt; and can print accordingly. Then, if you have a function which expects a &lt;code&gt;@udm&lt;/code&gt; and you try to pass it a &lt;code&gt;@udk&lt;/code&gt;, it will fail. The feature seems banal, but spacecraft have been laid low by less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is clearly a crude mechanism. If you don’t like it, you don’t have to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;known_odors&quot;&gt;Known odors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoon knows about the following odors, with defined meanings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;@c              UTF-32 codepoint
@d              date
  @da           absolute date
  @dr           relative date (ie, timespan)
@f              yes or no (inverse boolean)
@n              nil
@p              phonemic base
@r              IEEE floating-point
  @rd           double precision  (64 bits)
  @rh           half precision (16 bits)
  @rq           quad precision (128 bits)
  @rs           single precision (32 bits)
@s              signed integer, sign bit low
  @sb           signed binary
  @sd           signed decimal
  @sv           signed base32
  @sw           signed base64
  @sx           signed hexadecimal
@t              UTF-8 text (cord)
  @ta           ASCII text (span)
    @tas        ASCII symbol (term)
@u              unsigned integer
  @ub           unsigned binary
  @ud           unsigned decimal
  @uv           unsigned base32
  @uw           unsigned base64
  @ux           unsigned hexadecimal&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these forms has a URL-safe syntax, which we’ll get to. Each parses as an atomic constant in Hoon, and each is printed by the Hoon prettyprinter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first, a little more Hoonology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the_humble_type&quot;&gt;The humble type&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is a Hoon type, anyway? We know a type is a noun. So is everything. What are the semantics of this noun?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what this highly overloaded word may and does and does mean in every other system of computation that has deployed it, a type in Hoon has two roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One, it defines a set of nouns. Any finite noun is either in this set, or not in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two, it ascribes semantics to all nouns in this set. For example, a Hoon type exports a semantic namespace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this settled, let’s start by introducing, purely in an informal and totally friendly way, the &lt;code&gt;tile&lt;/code&gt; syntax in which &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; itself is defined in &lt;code&gt;/=main=/arvo/hoon/hoon&lt;/code&gt;. This is not the full definition of &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt;, just a simple subset:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;++  type  $|  ?(%noun %void)
          $%  [%atom p=term]
              [%cell p=type q=type]
          ==&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, never mind the syntax. We can easily describe this subset of &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; in plain English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be &lt;code&gt;%noun&lt;/code&gt; (ie, the atom &lt;code&gt;1.853.189.998&lt;/code&gt;). Set: all nouns. Examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; *
0
*

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -:!&amp;gt;(*)
%noun

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; `*`%noun
1.853.189.998
*

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -:!&amp;gt;(`*`%noun)
%noun&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be the atom &lt;code&gt;%void&lt;/code&gt;. Set: no nouns. We can’t show any examples producing &lt;code&gt;%void&lt;/code&gt; - by definition, none of them would terminate. Because that’s what &lt;code&gt;%void&lt;/code&gt; means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be the cell &lt;code&gt;[%atom p]&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;code&gt;term&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;@tas&lt;/code&gt;), possibly empty (ie, &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;). Set: all atoms. Examples: above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be the triple &lt;code&gt;[%cell p q]&lt;/code&gt; (ie, &lt;code&gt;[%cell [p q]]&lt;/code&gt;), where each of &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; is itself a &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt;. Set: all cells of &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt;. Examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; [3 4]
[3 4]
[@ud @ud]

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -:!&amp;gt;([3 4])
[%cell p=[%atom p=%ud] q=[%atom p=%ud]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the_noble_cube&quot;&gt;The noble cube&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s introduce another kind of type here, because we’ll need it to talk about constant syntax:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;++  type  $|  ?(%noun %void)
          $%  [%atom p=term]
              [%cell p=type q=type]
              [%cube p=* q=type]
          ==&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that when we enter an ordinary constant, like &lt;code&gt;42&lt;/code&gt;, its type &lt;code&gt;[%atom %ud]&lt;/code&gt; is the set of all atoms (with odor &lt;code&gt;@ud&lt;/code&gt;, but any atom can have that or any odor). Its type is certainly not the set consisting exclusively of the value &lt;code&gt;42&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here’s how we produce this “cubical” constant:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; %42
%42
%42

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -:!&amp;gt;(%42)
[%cube p=42 q=[%atom p=%ud]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, a &lt;code&gt;%cube&lt;/code&gt; type contains &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;, a single noun, and &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt;, a base type which provides semantics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syntactically, any atomic constant can be preceded by &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; to generate a cube. The exception is &lt;code&gt;@tas&lt;/code&gt;, which always needs &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; and is always cubical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;canonical_atom_syntaxes&quot;&gt;Canonical atom syntaxes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s briefly cover the syntax of each built-in odor. It would be counterproductive to specify them exactly here; first, this is a tutorial rather than a spec, and second the spec is the code. For the exact semantics, consult &lt;code&gt;++so&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;hoon.hoon&lt;/code&gt;. Rather, we’ll explain the form and run through some examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If some of these syntaxes seem contrived or odd, bear in mind: none of them collides with any of the others, and they are all URL-safe and more. The canonical atom forms use only lowercase characters, numbers, &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;. A cell form adds &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unsigned_decimal_&quot;&gt;Unsigned decimal, &lt;code&gt;@ud&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsigned decimal is the common or neutral atom representation. It’s not very compact and in many cases conveys no intelligible information at all, but it’s impossible to screw up. &lt;code&gt;@ud&lt;/code&gt; is the default print format for both &lt;code&gt;@u&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; - ie, unsigned numbers with no printing preference, and opaque atoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoon’s unsigned decimal format is the normal Continental syntax. It differs from the Anglo-American only in the use of periods, rather than commas, between groups of 3:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; 0

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; 19

65.536
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; (bex 20)
1.048.576&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An unsigned decimal not broken into groups is a syntax error. Also, whitespace or even linebreaks can appear between the dot and the next group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; 65.  536
65.536&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unsigned_hexadecimal_&quot;&gt;Unsigned hexadecimal, &lt;code&gt;@ux&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;@ux&lt;/code&gt; has the same syntax as &lt;code&gt;@ud&lt;/code&gt;, except that it’s prefixed by &lt;code&gt;0x&lt;/code&gt; and uses groups of four. Hex digits are lowercase only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; 0x0
0x0
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ud`0x17

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ux`(bex 20)
0x10.0000
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; 0x10.  0000
0x10.0000&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unsigned_base64_&quot;&gt;Unsigned base64, &lt;code&gt;@uw&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unsigned_base32_&quot;&gt;Unsigned base32, &lt;code&gt;@uv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prefix is &lt;code&gt;0w&lt;/code&gt; for base64 and &lt;code&gt;0v&lt;/code&gt; for base32. The digits for &lt;code&gt;@uw&lt;/code&gt; are, in order: &lt;code&gt;0-9&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;a-z&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;A-Z&lt;/code&gt;, -, ~:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ud`0w-
62&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For &lt;code&gt;@uv&lt;/code&gt;, the digits are &lt;code&gt;0-9&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;a-v&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;signed_decimal_&quot;&gt;Signed decimal, &lt;code&gt;@sd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;signed_hexadecimal_&quot;&gt;Signed hexadecimal, &lt;code&gt;@sx&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;signed_base64_&quot;&gt;Signed base64, &lt;code&gt;@sw&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;signed_base32_&quot;&gt;Signed base32, &lt;code&gt;@sv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;signed_binary_&quot;&gt;Signed binary, &lt;code&gt;@sb&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, without finite-sized integers, the sign extension trick does not work. A signed integer in Hoon is a different way to use atoms than an unsigned integer; even for positive numbers, the signed integer cannot equal the unsigned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prefix for a negative signed integer is a single &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; before the unsigned syntax. The prefix for a &lt;em&gt;positive&lt;/em&gt; signed integer is &lt;code&gt;--&lt;/code&gt;. The sign bit is the low bit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;absolute_date_&quot;&gt;Absolute date, &lt;code&gt;@da&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urbit dates represent 128-bit chronological time, with 2^64 seconds from the start of the universe to the end. 2^127 is 3:30:08 PM on December 5, AD 226, for reasons not clear or relevant:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@da`(bex 127)
~226.12.5..15.30.08

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@da`(dec (bex 127))
~226.12.5..15.30.07..ffff.ffff.ffff.ffff&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time of day and/or second fragment is optional:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ux`~2013.12.7
0x8000.000d.2140.7280.0000.0000.0000.0000

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ux`~2013.12.7..15.30.07..1234
0x8000.000d.2141.4c7f.1234.0000.0000.0000&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also do BC:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ux`~226-.12.5
0x7fff.fffc.afb1.b800.0000.0000.0000.0000&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The semantics of the time system are that UGT (Urbit Galactic Time) is GMT/UTC as of leap second 25. UGT is chronological and will never add leap seconds, even if UTC continues this mistake. If a gap appears, it must be resolved in the presentation layer, with timezones and other human curiosities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;relative_date_&quot;&gt;Relative date, &lt;code&gt;@dr&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also nice to have a syntax for basic time intervals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ux`~s1
0x1.0000.0000.0000.0000

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ux`~m1
0x3c.0000.0000.0000.0000

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; (div ~m1 ~s1)
60

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; (div ~h1 ~m1)
60

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; (div ~h1 ~s1)
3.600

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; (div ~d1 ~h1)
24

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@da`(add ~2013.11.30 ~d1)
~2013.12.1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no &lt;code&gt;@dr&lt;/code&gt; intervals under a second or over a day. Since the resolution is so high, though, &lt;code&gt;(div ~s1 1.000.000)&lt;/code&gt; produces a pretty accurate microsecond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;loobean_&quot;&gt;Loobean, &lt;code&gt;@f&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A loobean, or just &lt;code&gt;bean&lt;/code&gt;, is 0 or 1. &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; is yes, &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; is no:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ud`.y
0
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ud`.n
1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who find this strange are probably strange themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nil_&quot;&gt;Nil, &lt;code&gt;@n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nil indicates an absence of information, as in a list terminator. The only value is &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ud`~
0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unicode_text_&quot;&gt;Unicode text, &lt;code&gt;@t&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;@t&lt;/code&gt; is a sequence of UTF-8 bytes, LSB first - sometimes called a &lt;code&gt;cord&lt;/code&gt;. For lowercase numbers and letters, the canonical syntax is &lt;code&gt;~~text&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; ~~foo
&amp;#39;foo&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the prettyprinter makes an unprincipled exception and prints the text in a noncanonical format:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ux`~~foo
0x6f.6f66&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to be able to encode an arbitrary Unicode string as a single URL-safe token, using no punctuation but &lt;code&gt;.~-&lt;/code&gt;, in &lt;code&gt;@t&lt;/code&gt;. Space is &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;~.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;~~&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; ~~foo.bar
&amp;#39;foo bar&amp;#39;
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; ~~foo.bar~.baz~~moo-hoo
&amp;#39;foo bar.baz~moo-hoo&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all other ASCII/Unicode characters, insert the Unicode codepoint in lower-case hexadecimal, followed by &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;. For example, for U+2605 “BLACK STAR”, write:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; ~~foo~2605.bar
&amp;#39;foo★bar&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This UTF-32 codepoint is of course converted to UTF-8:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ux`~~foo~2605.bar
0x72.6162.8598.e26f.6f66&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;urlsafe_ascii_text_&quot;&gt;URL-safe ASCII text, &lt;code&gt;@ta&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;@ta&lt;/code&gt; encodes the ASCII subset that all canonical atom syntaxes restrict themselves to. The prefix is &lt;code&gt;~.&lt;/code&gt;. There are no escape sequences except &lt;code&gt;~~&lt;/code&gt;, which means &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;~-&lt;/code&gt;, which means &lt;code&gt;\_&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; encode themselves. No other characters besides numbers and lowercase letters need apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s cast these to &lt;code&gt;@t&lt;/code&gt; to see them quoted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@t`~.foo
&amp;#39;foo&amp;#39;
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@t`~.foo.bar
&amp;#39;foo.bar&amp;#39;
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@t`~.foo~~bar
&amp;#39;foo~bar&amp;#39;
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@t`~.foo~-bar
&amp;#39;foo_bar&amp;#39;
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@t`~.foo-bar
&amp;#39;foo-bar&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;@ta&lt;/code&gt; atom is called a &lt;code&gt;span&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;codepoint_&quot;&gt;Codepoint, &lt;code&gt;@c&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally when we build atoms of Unicode text, we use a UTF-8 bytestream, LSB first. But sometimes it’s useful to build atoms of one or more UTF-32 words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The codepoint syntax is the same as &lt;code&gt;@t&lt;/code&gt;, except with a &lt;code&gt;~-&lt;/code&gt; prefix. Let’s repeat our examples, with hex display:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ux`~-foo
0x6f.0000.006f.0000.0066

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ux`~-foo.bar
0x72.0000.0061.0000.0062.0000.0020.0000.006f.0000.006f.0000.0066&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;phonemic_&quot;&gt;Phonemic, &lt;code&gt;@p&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen &lt;code&gt;@p&lt;/code&gt; used for ships, of course. But it’s not just for ships - it’s for any short number optimized for memorability, not for arithmetic. &lt;code&gt;@p&lt;/code&gt; is great for checksums, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, &lt;code&gt;@p&lt;/code&gt; is subtly customized for the sociopolitical design of Urbit as a digital republic. For example, one feature we &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; want is the ability to see at a glance which carrier and cruiser issued a destroyer. Consider the carrier &lt;code&gt;0x21&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@p`0x21
~mep&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It issues &lt;code&gt;255&lt;/code&gt; cruisers, including &lt;code&gt;0x4321&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@p`0x4321
~pasnut&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which issues &lt;code&gt;65.535&lt;/code&gt; destroyers, including &lt;code&gt;0x8765.4321&lt;/code&gt; and several successors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@p`0x8765.4321
~famsyr-dirwes
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@p`0x8766.4321
~lidlug-maprec
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@p`0x8767.4321
~tidlus-roplen
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@p`0x8768.4321
~lisnel-lonbet&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, anyone who can juggle bits can see that &lt;code&gt;~famsyr-dirwes&lt;/code&gt; is a close cousin of &lt;code&gt;~lidlug-maprec&lt;/code&gt;. But she actually has to juggle bits to do it. Obfuscation does not prevent calculated associations, just automatic ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at the yacht level, we actually want to see a uniform 32-bit space of yachts directly associated with the destroyer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@p`0x9.8765.4321
~talfes-sibwaclux-tomwyc-famsyr-dirwes
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@p`0xba9.8765.4321
~tacbep-ronreg-famsyr-dirwes
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@p`0xd.cba9.8765.4321
~bicsub-ritbyt-famsyr-dirwes
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@p`0xfed.cba9.8765.4321
~sivrep-hadfeb-famsyr-dirwes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ipv4_address_&quot;&gt;IPv4 address, &lt;code&gt;@if&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ipv6_address_&quot;&gt;IPv6 address, &lt;code&gt;@is&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urbit lives atop IP and would be very foolish to not support a syntax for the large atoms that are IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;@if&lt;/code&gt; is the standard IPv4 syntax, prefixed with &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ux`.127.0.0.1
0x7f00.0001&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;@is&lt;/code&gt; is the same as &lt;code&gt;@if&lt;/code&gt;, but with 8 groups of 4 hex digits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ux`.dead.beef.0.cafe.42.babe.dead.beef
0xdead.beef.0000.cafe.0042.babe.dead.beef&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ieee_singleprecision_&quot;&gt;IEEE single-precision, &lt;code&gt;@rs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ieee_doubleprecision_&quot;&gt;IEEE double-precision, &lt;code&gt;@rd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ieee_quadprecision_&quot;&gt;IEEE quad-precision, &lt;code&gt;@rq&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ieee_halfprecision_&quot;&gt;IEEE half-precision, &lt;code&gt;@rh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoon does not yet support floating point, so these syntaxes don’t actually work. But the syntax for a single-precision float is the normal English syntax, with a &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; prefix:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;.6.2832             ::  τ as @rs
.-6.2832            ::  -τ as @
.~6.2832            ::  τ as @rd
.~-6.2832           ::  -τ as @rd
.~~6.2832           ::  τ as @rh
.~~~6.2832          ::  τ as @rq&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Hoon is a Tauist language and promotes International Tau Day.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;transparent_cell_syntax&quot;&gt;Transparent cell syntax&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By adding &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt;, we can encode arbitrary nouns in our safe subset. The prefix to a canonical cell is &lt;code&gt;._&lt;/code&gt;; the separator is &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt;; the terminator is &lt;code&gt;__&lt;/code&gt;. Thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; ._3_4__
[3 4]

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; ._.127.0.0.1_._0x12_19___~tasfyn-partyv__
[.127.0.0.1 [0x12 19] ~tasfyn-partyv]
[@if [@ux @ud] @p]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who don’t see utility in this strange feature have perhaps never needed to jam a data structure into a URL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;opaque_noun_syntax&quot;&gt;Opaque noun syntax&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of jam, sometimes we really don’t care what’s inside our noun. Then, the syntax to use is a variant of &lt;code&gt;@uw&lt;/code&gt; prefixed by &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;, which incorporates the built-in &lt;code&gt;jam&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cue&lt;/code&gt; marshallers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; (jam [3 4])
78.241
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@uw`(jam [3 4])
0wj6x
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; (cue 0wj6x)
[3 4]
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; ~0wj6x
[3 4]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;noncanonical_syntaxes&quot;&gt;Noncanonical syntaxes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are syntaxes for constants which don’t fit the canonical character-set constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hoon_symbol_&quot;&gt;Hoon symbol, &lt;code&gt;@tas&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;@tas&lt;/code&gt;, a &lt;code&gt;term&lt;/code&gt;, is our most exclusive odor. The only characters permitted are lowercase ASCII, &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; except as the first or last character, and &lt;code&gt;0-9&lt;/code&gt; except as the first character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The syntax for &lt;code&gt;@tas&lt;/code&gt; is the text itself, always preceded by &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;. This means a term is always cubical. You can cast it to &lt;code&gt;@tas&lt;/code&gt; if you like, but we just about always want the cube:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; %dead-fish9
%dead-fish9

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -:!&amp;gt;(%dead-fish9)
[%cube p=271.101.667.197.767.630.546.276 q=[%atom p=%tas]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The empty &lt;code&gt;@tas&lt;/code&gt; has a special syntax, &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; %$
%$&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A term without &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; is not a constant, but a name:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; dead-fish9
! -find-limb.dead-fish9
! find-none
! exit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;loobeans_&quot;&gt;Loobeans, &lt;code&gt;@f&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;.y&lt;/code&gt; is a little cumbersome, so we can say &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; prefix cubes as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ud`&amp;amp;
0
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ud`|
1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cords_&quot;&gt;Cords, &lt;code&gt;@t&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The canonical &lt;code&gt;~~&lt;/code&gt; syntax for &lt;code&gt;@t&lt;/code&gt;, while it has its place, is intolerable in a number of ways - especially when it comes to escaping capitals. So &lt;code&gt;@t&lt;/code&gt; is both printed and parsed in a conventional-looking single-quote syntax:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; &amp;#39;foo bar&amp;#39;
&amp;#39;foo bar&amp;#39;
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ux`&amp;#39;foo bar&amp;#39;
0x72.6162.206f.6f66&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Escape &lt;code&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; &amp;#39;Foo \&amp;#39;bar&amp;#39;
&amp;#39;Foo \&amp;#39;bar&amp;#39;
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ux`&amp;#39;\&amp;#39;&amp;#39;
0x27&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strings&quot;&gt;Strings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Text in Hoon is generally manipulated in two ways, depending on what you’re doing: as an atomic cord/span/term, or as a &lt;code&gt;tape&lt;/code&gt; which is a list of bytes (_not_ codepoints).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To generate a tape, use double quotes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; &amp;quot;foo&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;foo&amp;quot;
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `*`&amp;quot;foo&amp;quot;
[102 111 111 0]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re getting off the constant reservation, but strings also interpolate with curly-braces:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; &amp;quot;hello {(weld &amp;quot;wor&amp;quot; &amp;quot;ld&amp;quot;)} is a fun thing to say&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;hello world is a fun thing to say&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they can be joined across space or lines with a &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; &amp;quot;hello&amp;quot;.&amp;quot;world&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;helloworld&amp;quot;
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; &amp;quot;hello&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;world&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;helloworld&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;urbit-is-easy-ch4.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prev&lt;/strong&gt;: Using Nock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;urbit-is-easy-ch6.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt;: Moar Hoon Types&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <updated>2013-11-18T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://urbit.org/2013/11/18/urbit-is-easy-ch4</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;urbit-is-easy-ch3.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prev&lt;/strong&gt;: Nock Is Easy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;urbit-is-easy-ch5.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt;: Hoon Attacks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“But are you crazy enough?”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(Point Break)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;playing_with_nock&quot;&gt;Playing with Nock&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we’re going to actually do some cool stuff with Nock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, we have an entire OS, Arvo, which is built on Nock. Unfortunately, there’s really no practical reason to work directly in Nock when you’re using Arvo - except for learning Nock, which you do once and never again. So the things we’ll have to do are a little bit cumbersome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Arvo is good at is evaluating Hoon. And it’s possible to evaluate Nock from Hoon, much the way you can put inline assembly in C. Through this indirection, we have two ways to run Nock in Hoon: on the command line and via an app file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;command_line&quot;&gt;Command line&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the Arvo command line, you can run one-liners with the Hoon rune &lt;code&gt;.*&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; .*(42 [4 0 1])
43&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;application_file&quot;&gt;Application file&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the Arvo command line doesn’t do multiline input well, and if there’s any hope of writing complex Nock formulas it’s by using plenty of whitespace and linebreaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we’ve constructed a template for writing Nock formulas as Arvo applications. Unfortunately Arvo is a young OS and has no way to edit a file. But Arvo runs on Unix and Unix is a very old OS. Arvo syncs its filesystem with your &lt;code&gt;$URBIT_HOME&lt;/code&gt; directory, propagating changes on either side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume your &lt;code&gt;$URBIT_HOME&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;urb/&lt;/code&gt;, and your ship is &lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc&lt;/code&gt;. The Nock application template is in&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;urb/waclux-tomwyc/try/bin/nock.hoon&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its text should be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;!:             ::  To write Nock as an Arvo application in Hoon
|=  *          ::
|=  [a=* ~]    ::  For educational purposes only
:_  ~  :_  ~   ::
:-  %la        ::  Preserve this mysterious boilerplate square
%+  sell  %noun::
.*  a          ::  Replace the formula with your own
:::::::::::::::::
               ::  Formula: increment
[4 0 1]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the rest of this document we’ll simply assume you can copy boilerplate, and write the rest of the file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[4 0 1]                           ::    bump /1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The pseudocode in the comments is not in any way described. If you have trouble figuring it out, that’s okay, because it should make itself obvious by the end of the document.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test this by running:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :nock 42
43&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first complex example will be a decrement function. With or without &lt;code&gt;vere&lt;/code&gt; running, copy the template from Unix:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ cp urb/waclux-tomwyc/try/bin/nock.hoon urb/waclux-tomwyc/try/bin/dec.hoon&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, use a Unix editor to change “Formula: increment” to “Formula: decrement” in &lt;code&gt;dec.hoon&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either next time you start &lt;code&gt;vere&lt;/code&gt;, or on your next keyboard event if you’re already running it, you’ll see something like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; + /~waclux-tomwyc/try/1/bin/dec/hoon&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arvo has slurped up dec.hoon from your filesystem. To test it,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :dec 42
43&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, we didn’t change the formula, so it still increments. But it’s a start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;decrement&quot;&gt;Decrement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only arithmetic operation in Nock is increment. So how do we decrement? The algorithm is obvious: to decrement &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;, start from &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, and count up to &lt;code&gt;n-1&lt;/code&gt;. Or rather, count up to a number &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; such that &lt;code&gt;m+1&lt;/code&gt; equals &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Is this going to be an &lt;code&gt;O(n)&lt;/code&gt; algorithm? It is. How do we compute effectively in a platform where decrement is &lt;code&gt;O(n)&lt;/code&gt;? Gosh, it seems difficult, doesn’t it? We’ll get to that.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing we’re going to need is a counter. Right now our subject is just the atom we’re trying to decrement - &lt;code&gt;/1&lt;/code&gt;, referenced with the formula &lt;code&gt;[0 1]&lt;/code&gt;. Thus, to increment it, the formula is &lt;code&gt;[4 0 1]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s try to put the counter into the subject with one of our macros operators, &lt;code&gt;8&lt;/code&gt;. Recall our revised rule for &lt;code&gt;8&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;34r::    *[a 8 b c]       *[[*[a b] a] c]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The formula &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; is applied to the subject &lt;code&gt;[*[a b] a]&lt;/code&gt;. What is our &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;? It should just produce our initial counter value - 0. So, use operator &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; to produce a constant - &lt;code&gt;[1 0]&lt;/code&gt;. Let’s put this counter in the subject, and then increment as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit &lt;code&gt;dec.hoon&lt;/code&gt; so that the formula reads&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ 8                               ::  push
  [1 0]                           ::    just 0
  [4 0 1]                         ::    bump /1
]                                 ::&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that for these tall bracket structures, the space after &lt;code&gt;[&lt;/code&gt; is essential. Then, you’ll see the file automatically update in Arvo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;: /~waclux-tomwyc/try/2/bin/dec/hoon
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :dec 42&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoops! It crashed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;! /~waclux-tomwyc/try/~2013.11.26..00.01.38..499b/bin/dec/:&amp;lt;[4 1].[13 2]&amp;gt;
! /~waclux-tomwyc/try/~2013.11.26..00.01.38..499b/bin/dec/:&amp;lt;[4 8].[13 2]&amp;gt;
! /~waclux-tomwyc/try/~2013.11.26..00.01.38..499b/bin/dec/:&amp;lt;[5 1].[13 2]&amp;gt;
! /~waclux-tomwyc/try/~2013.11.26..00.01.38..499b/bin/dec/:&amp;lt;[6 1].[13 2]&amp;gt;
! /~waclux-tomwyc/try/~2013.11.26..00.01.38..499b/bin/dec/:&amp;lt;[7 1].[13 2]&amp;gt;
! exit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did we do wrong? We forgot that the subject had changed. When we get to &lt;code&gt;[4 0 1]&lt;/code&gt;, the subject is not &lt;code&gt;42&lt;/code&gt;, but &lt;code&gt;[0 42]&lt;/code&gt; - the counter is there. So our original argument, &lt;code&gt;42&lt;/code&gt;, is actually at &lt;code&gt;/3&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ 8                               ::  push
  [1 0]                           ::   just 0
  [4 0 3]                         ::   bump /3
]                                 ::

: /~waclux-tomwyc/try/3/bin/dec/hoon
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :dec 42
43&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, at least it increments again. (Constantly readjusting tree addresses by hand is one good reason to use a higher-level language, like Hoon.) But now, perhaps, we can build a decrement that works for at least one input value - &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously at some point we’ll have to build a loop. But for now, all we need is an &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement that compares the incremented counter to the original argument. We know the original argument is at &lt;code&gt;/3&lt;/code&gt;, and the counter is at &lt;code&gt;/2&lt;/code&gt;; we use the if operator, &lt;code&gt;6&lt;/code&gt;, and the equality test operator &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt;. If the comparison fails, we shrug our shoulders and keep incrementing the argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ 8                               ::  push
  [1 0]                           ::   just 0
  [ 6                             ::   pick
    [5 [4 0 2] [0 3]]             ::    same (bump /2) /3
    [0 2]                         ::    /2
    [4 0 3]                       ::    bump /3
  ]                               ::   |
]                                 ::  |

: /~waclux-tomwyc/try/4/bin/dec/hoon
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :dec 42
43
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :dec 1
0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re getting closer. But now, that loop:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up till now, our subject has contained only data. If we want to loop, we’re obviously going to have to bite the bullet and put code in our subject - which will become a &lt;code&gt;[code data]&lt;/code&gt; cell. In Nock (and Hoon) this is called a &lt;code&gt;core&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose we take our &lt;code&gt;6&lt;/code&gt; formula and put it in the subject. Then, with this core subject &lt;code&gt;[formula counter argument]&lt;/code&gt;, we’ll run the formula itself. With this subject, the formula is &lt;code&gt;/2&lt;/code&gt;, and of course the core itself is &lt;code&gt;/1&lt;/code&gt;. So we can activate the core with &lt;code&gt;[2 [0 1] [0 2]]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, since the subject has changed again, we need to change the addresses again. The counter is now &lt;code&gt;/6&lt;/code&gt; and the argument is now &lt;code&gt;/7&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ 8                               ::  push
  [1 0]                           ::   just 0
  [ 8                             ::   push
    [ 1                           ::    quid
      [ 6                         ::     pick
        [5 [4 0 6] [0 7]]         ::      same (bump /6) /7
        [0 6]                     ::      /6
        [4 0 7]                   ::      bump /7
      ]                           ::     |
    ]                             ::    |
    [2 [0 1] [0 2]]               ::    nock /1 /2
  ]                               ::   |
]                                 ::  |&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does exactly the same thing as before:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;: /~waclux-tomwyc/try/5/bin/dec/hoon
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :dec 42
43
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :dec 1
0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But somehow, we feel it &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do better. Why? Because where we do the useless &lt;code&gt;[4 0 7]&lt;/code&gt;, we have a subject containing the code we want to invoke. It’s just that the counter is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to do the same thing as &lt;code&gt;[2 [0 1] [0 2]&lt;/code&gt;, but the subject is not &lt;code&gt;[0 1]&lt;/code&gt;. That would be &lt;code&gt;[formula counter argument]&lt;/code&gt;. We need &lt;code&gt;[formula (counter + 1) argument]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;code&gt;formula&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;[0 2]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;counter&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;[0 6]&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;argument&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;[0 7]&lt;/code&gt;. With autocons, we can just put them together to make a (superfluous) formula for &lt;code&gt;[formula counter argument]&lt;/code&gt; - ie,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[[0 2] [0 6] [0 7]]               ::  cons /2 /6 /7&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we actually want to increment the counter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[[0 2] [4 0 6] [0 7]]             ::  cons /2 (bump /6) /7&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to invoke our formula on this modified core:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[2 [[0 2] [4 0 6] [0 7]] [0 2]]   ::  nock (cons /2 (bump /6) /7) /2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we put this into the decrement, it should actually work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ 8                               ::  push
  [1 0]                           ::   just 0
  [ 8                             ::   push
    [ 1                           ::    quid
      [ 6                         ::     pick
        [5 [4 0 6] [0 7]]         ::      same (bump /6) /7
        [0 6]                     ::      /6
        [ 2                       ::      nock
           [[0 2] [4 0 6] [0 7]]  ::       (cons /2 (bump /6) /7)
           [0 2]                  ::       /2
        ]                         ::      |
      ]                           ::     |
    ]                             ::    |
    [2 [0 1] [0 2]]               ::    nock /1 /2
  ]                               ::   |
]                                 ::  |&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it does:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;: /~waclux-tomwyc/try/6/bin/dec/hoon
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :dec 42
41&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s one more step. Remember operator &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;35 ::    *[a 9 b c]       *[a 7 c 2 [0 1] 0 b]
35r::    *[a 9 b c]       *[*[a c] *[*[a c] 0 b]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; is a formula that produces a core. Then we see immediately what &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt; does: it activates a core, using the formula at &lt;code&gt;/b&lt;/code&gt; within the core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we can rewrite our decrement to use &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ 8                               ::  push
  [1 0]                           ::   just 0
  [ 8                             ::   push
    [ 1                           ::    quid
      [ 6                         ::     pick
        [5 [4 0 6] [0 7]]         ::      same (bump /6) /7
        [0 6]                     ::      /6
        [9 2 [0 2] [4 0 6] [0 7]] ::      call.2 (cons /2 (bump /6) /7)
      ]                           ::     |
    ]                             ::    |
    [9 2 0 1]                     ::    call.2 /1
  ]                               ::   |
]                                 ::  |&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seems to work nicely:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;: /~waclux-tomwyc/try/6/bin/dec/hoon
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :dec 42
41&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are limits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :dec 0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll have to hit &lt;code&gt;^C&lt;/code&gt;, and you’ll see a big ugly error stack. Nock can work wonders but it can’t decrement 0. (Yes, you can build signed integers in Hoon - they are represented as atoms with the sign bit low.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a_function&quot;&gt;A function&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we start to build up toward language-level primitives, it behooves us to do things the way a higher-level language would do them. Well, more exactly, the way Hoon does things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, although a formula defines a function of the subject, a function - at the language level - is not the same thing as a formula. Or rather, the argument is not the same thing as the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, as we saw in decrement, the subject for the loop needs to contain the code itself. If we apply a formula which can’t call back into itself, our ability to loop is sorely diminished. So at the very least, when we call a function, the subject can’t just be &lt;code&gt;argument&lt;/code&gt; - it has to be the cell &lt;code&gt;[formula argument]&lt;/code&gt;, so that the function can recurse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, it’s confusing to say &lt;code&gt;argument&lt;/code&gt;, because this implies a special status for single and multiple arguments. In Nock and Hoon, we say &lt;code&gt;sample&lt;/code&gt;, which is always one thing, but can be a cell for “functions of two arguments”, a triple for three, etc. Eg, the sample for a decrement function is an atom; the sample for an add function is a cell of two atoms; etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a function needs more data than just the argument - it might, for instance, want to call other functions. Where’s it going to get them? There is no external environment in Nock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the standard convention for a Nock function - or a Hoon function - is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[formula sample context]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code&gt;formula&lt;/code&gt; is the code, &lt;code&gt;sample&lt;/code&gt; is the argument(s), and &lt;code&gt;context&lt;/code&gt; is any other data and/or code that may be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a bit irregular that we are taking the external subject and using it directly from our formula. Let’s try to build a function with this convention and call it directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we’ll build an increment function to keep things simple. We actually don’t need anything in the context, so we’ll put 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ 8                               ::  push
  [                               ::   cons
    [1 [4 0 6]]                   ::    quid bump /6  ::  formula
    [1 0]                         ::    just 0        ::  sample
    [1 0]                         ::    just 0        ::  context
  ]                               ::   |
  [ 9                             ::   call
    2                             ::    .2
    [0 4] [0 3] [0 11]            ::    cons /4 /3 /11
  ]                               ::   |
]                                 ::  |&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why &lt;code&gt;[[0 4] [0 3] [0 11]]&lt;/code&gt;? Our goal in calling the function is to take the blank default core we’ve created at &lt;code&gt;/2&lt;/code&gt;, and substitute in the original subject of the outer formula, which before the outer &lt;code&gt;8&lt;/code&gt; was &lt;code&gt;/1&lt;/code&gt; and is now &lt;code&gt;/3&lt;/code&gt;. Around this we wrap the formula from the default core, at &lt;code&gt;/4&lt;/code&gt;, and the (dummy) context, at &lt;code&gt;/11&lt;/code&gt; - that is, &lt;code&gt;/7&lt;/code&gt; within &lt;code&gt;/2&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s fit our decrement into this framework:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ 8                                     ::  push
  [                                     ::   cons
    [ 1                                 ::    quid    ::  formula
      [ 8                               ::     push
        [1 0]                           ::      just 0
        [ 8                             ::      push
          [ 1                           ::       quid
            [ 6                         ::        pick
              [5 [4 0 6] [0 30]]        ::         same /6 /30
              [0 6]                     ::         /6
              [9 2 [0 2] [4 0 6] [0 7]] ::         call.2 /2 (bump /6) /11
            ]                           ::        |
          ]                             ::       |
          [9 2 0 1]                     ::       call.2 /1
        ]                               ::      |
      ]                                 ::     |
    ]                                   ::    |
    [1 0]                               ::    just 0  ::  sample
    [1 0]                               ::    just 0  ::  context
  ]                                     ::   |
  [9 2 [0 4] [0 3] [0 11]]              ::   call.2 /4 /3 /11
]                                       ::  |&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observe that nothing has changed from the way we called our increment function, and only one thing has changed within the decrement formula - the axis of the argument. Now at &lt;code&gt;/7&lt;/code&gt; is not the naked argument to decrement, but our outer core. The sample is at &lt;code&gt;/6&lt;/code&gt; within this &lt;code&gt;/7&lt;/code&gt;, ie, at &lt;code&gt;/30&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a_library&quot;&gt;A library&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frankly, this is getting close to the limits of anything you’d want to do in hand-generated Nock. But why not press on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we’d really like to do is build a library of functions that can call each other. It’s easy to guess that this library will be a core. But what does this core look like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A function core, &lt;code&gt;[formula sample context]&lt;/code&gt;, is a very useful kind of core, but it’s not the only kind of core. (Actually, because the word “function” is too easy to throw around, we have a special name for a function core: we call it a &lt;code&gt;gate&lt;/code&gt;. Compare to “lambda” or “closure.”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in general, a core is just &lt;code&gt;[code data]&lt;/code&gt; - or, to use more lingo, &lt;code&gt;[battery payload]&lt;/code&gt;. The payload can be anything - it’s just data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The battery can be one &lt;em&gt;or more&lt;/em&gt; formulas, each of which is applied with the core as its subject. This is why &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt; takes the axis operand &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;. If the core is a gate, the battery is just one formula; this is the head of the core, so &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not every core is a gate. Suppose we want to build a library? We could assemble a bundle of cores and put it in the context. So, let’s say we need to write subtract, which obviously is going to use decrement. So, the context will be&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[subtract-gate decrement-gate]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait. Each gate is &lt;code&gt;[formula sample context]&lt;/code&gt;. So, because Nock doesn’t do cycles, there’s no way the subtract gate and the decrement gate can each reference each other through the context. It happens to be the case here that subtract needs decrement, but decrement doesn’t need subtract. But we’re not looking for ugly at this point - we know Nock is more than capable of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support general mutual recursion, our library needs to be a battery in which each formula produces a gate. The context of that gate is the library core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s repeat this again because it’s so important. Our library will be a battery in which each formula produces a gate. The context of that gate is the library core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s build a trivial library core of this form, with one function, good old increment. Then, we’ll call it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ 8                               ::  push
  [                               ::   cons
    [ 1                           ::    quid          ::  battery
      [1 [4 0 6]]                 ::     quid bump /6
      [1 0]                       ::     just 0
      [0 1]                       ::     /1
    ]                             ::    |
    [1 0]                         ::    just 0        ::  payload
  ]                               ::   |
  [ 8                             ::   push
    [9 2 0 2]                     ::    call.2 /2
    [9 2 [0 4] [0 7] [0 11]]      ::    call.2 /4 /7 /11
  ]                               ::   |
]                                 ::  |&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare this to the standalone increment above. It’s obviously more complex and it should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, what we put in the library core is not the function gate directly, but a formula that generates the gate. This way, and only this way, we can put the library itself in the context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, what’s the payload of the library core? It’s &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, because the library doesn’t depend on anything. It certainly doesn’t depend on the argument to our application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, now we can’t just call the gate directly. We have to actually build it. So we need another &lt;code&gt;8&lt;/code&gt; to “push it on the stack”, and then we call it with the usual &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt;. Since the subject at this point is &lt;code&gt;[gate library argument]&lt;/code&gt;, the sample we use is &lt;code&gt;[0 7]&lt;/code&gt; rather than &lt;code&gt;[0 3]&lt;/code&gt; - everything else is the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But does it work? C’mon, you know it works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :dec 42
43&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, let’s go ahead and put our actual decrement function in the library. We won’t write the pseudocode here, because it’s an excellent exercise to add it - see below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ 8
  [
    [ 1
      [ 1
        [ 8
          [1 0]
          [ 8
            [ 1
              [ 6
                [5 [4 0 6] [0 30]]
                [0 6]
                [9 2 [0 2] [4 0 6] [0 7]]
              ]
            ]
            [9 2 0 1]
          ]
        ]
      ]
      [1 0]
      [0 1]
    ]
    [1 0]
  ]
  [ 8
    [9 2 0 2]
    [ 9
      2
      [0 4] [0 7] [0 11]
    ]
  ]
]

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :dec 42
43&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, let’s go crazy and add a subtract function, which calls decrement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ 8
  [
    [
      [ 1
        [ 1
          [ 8
            [9 5 0 7]
            [ 6
              [5 [1 0] [0 29]]
              [0 28]
              [ 9
                2
                [0 6]
                [ [9 2 [0 4] [0 28] [0 15]]
                  [9 2 [0 4] [0 29] [0 15]]
                ]
                [0 15]
              ]
            ]

&lt;p&gt;Note that the call to build the gate is &lt;code&gt;[9 4 0 2]&lt;/code&gt;, because the subtract arm is the head of the battery, which is the head of the core - ie, &lt;code&gt;/2&lt;/code&gt; within &lt;code&gt;/2&lt;/code&gt; - ie, &lt;code&gt;/4&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this work? Really?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :dec [42 12]
30&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;exercises&quot;&gt;Exercises&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you actually know Nock now? Well, possibly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good exercise is to add more simple math functions to this battery. Try add, multiply, and divide. One way to start is by walking through the uncommented routines above, putting pseudocode comments on them, and figuring out what they’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computing axes is slightly arduous (which is why we use Hoon, generally). We are torturing ourselves by using Nock, but we might as well use Hoon to calculate axes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; (peg 3 3)
7
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; (peg 3 5)
13&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ie, &lt;code&gt;(peg a b)&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;/b&lt;/code&gt; within &lt;code&gt;/a&lt;/code&gt;. Writing Nock without this would be pretty tough.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;urbit-is-easy-ch2.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prev&lt;/strong&gt;: Intro To Nock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;urbit-is-easy-ch4.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt;: Using Nock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“You get used to it. I don’t even see the code. All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(The Matrix)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fundamentals&quot;&gt;Fundamentals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have all the tools, let’s learn Nock from scratch. Here are all the rules defining &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;23 ::    *[a [b c] d]     [*[a b c] *[a d]]
24 ::
25 ::    *[a 0 b]         /[b a]
26 ::    *[a 1 b]         b
27 ::    *[a 2 b c]       *[*[a b] *[a c]]
28 ::    *[a 3 b]         ?*[a b]
29 ::    *[a 4 b]         +*[a b]
30 ::    *[a 5 b]         =*[a b]
31 ::
32 ::    *[a 6 b c d]     *[a 2 [0 1] 2 [1 c d] [1 0] 2 [1 2 3] [1 0] 4 4 b]
33 ::    *[a 7 b c]       *[a 2 b 1 c]
34 ::    *[a 8 b c]       *[a 7 [[7 [0 1] b] 0 1] c]
35 ::    *[a 9 b c]       *[a 7 c 2 [0 1] 0 b]
36 ::    *[a 10 [b c] d]  *[a 8 c 7 [0 3] d]
37 ::    *[a 10 b c]      *[a c]
38 ::
39 ::    *a               *a&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we saw in the last chapter, when &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is an atom, &lt;code&gt;*a&lt;/code&gt; is always an error. So Nock proper is a function of a cell. Informally, that cell is always described as a pair&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[subject formula]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where &lt;code&gt;subject&lt;/code&gt; is the data and &lt;code&gt;formula&lt;/code&gt; is the program. Notice that &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; in the rules above, except 39, is always the subject. So: let’s learn how to write a Nock formula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;autocons&quot;&gt;Autocons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We observe from the rules above that a formula, too, is always a cell. But when we look inside that cell, we see two basic kinds of formulas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[operator operands]
[formula formula]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An operator is always an atom (&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; through &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;). A formula is always a cell. Line 23 distinguishes these forms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;23 ::    *[a [b c] d]     [*[a b c] *[a d]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose you have two formulas &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt;, each of which computes some function of the subject &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;. You can then construct the formula &lt;code&gt;h&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;[f g]&lt;/code&gt;; and &lt;code&gt;h(s)&lt;/code&gt; equals &lt;code&gt;[f(s) g(s)]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, recall our computation from the last chapter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[[19 42] [0 3] 0 2]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;[19 42]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;[0 3]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;[0 2]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;h&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;[[0 3] 0
2]&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;f(s)&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;42&lt;/code&gt;; &lt;code&gt;g(s)&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;19&lt;/code&gt;; so &lt;code&gt;h(s)&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;[42 19]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? We could have an operator &lt;code&gt;11&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cons&lt;/code&gt; to a Lisp veteran, with the operands &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; - so instead of writing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[[0 3] 0 2]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we’d say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[11 [0 3] 0 2]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not only is this less elegant, it’s less convenient. Of course, convenience at the Nock level matters little, but we repeat this pattern at the Hoon level - where it’s often more pleasant to say &lt;code&gt;[a b]&lt;/code&gt; than &lt;code&gt;(cons a b)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;basic_operators&quot;&gt;Basic operators&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nock is small, but it could be smaller. If we didn’t care at all about the efficiency of the interpreter - in other words, if Nock was a theoretical exercise rather than a practical tool - we could make do with just the first six operators:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;25 ::    *[a 0 b]         /[b a]
26 ::    *[a 1 b]         b
27 ::    *[a 2 b c]       *[*[a b] *[a c]]
28 ::    *[a 3 b]         ?*[a b]
29 ::    *[a 4 b]         +*[a b]
30 ::    *[a 5 b]         =*[a b]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s run through them one by one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; just applies the &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;25 ::    *[a 0 b]         /[b a]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For any subject &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, the formula &lt;code&gt;[0 b]&lt;/code&gt; produces &lt;code&gt;/[b a]&lt;/code&gt;, which is why&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[[19 42] 0 3]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is &lt;code&gt;/[3 19 42]&lt;/code&gt;, which is &lt;code&gt;42&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;_2&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; just ignores its subject and produces its operand:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;26 ::    *[a 1 b]         b&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;_3&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt; is the only interesting basic operator:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;27 ::    *[a 2 b c]       *[*[a b] *[a c]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we generate a calculation to perform. Given the formula &lt;code&gt;[2
b c]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is a formula for generating the new subject; &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; is a formula for generating the new formula. To compute &lt;code&gt;*[a 2 b c]&lt;/code&gt;, we evaluate both &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; against the current subject &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;__&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt; just apply &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; respectively - that is, cell/atom, increment, and equals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;28 ::    *[a 3 b]         ?*[a b]
29 ::    *[a 4 b]         +*[a b]
30 ::    *[a 5 b]         =*[a b]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;macros&quot;&gt;Macros&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operators &lt;code&gt;6&lt;/code&gt; through &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt; are all essentially macros:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;32 ::    *[a 6 b c d]     *[a 2 [0 1] 2 [1 c d] [1 0] 2 [1 2 3] [1 0] 4 4 b]
33 ::    *[a 7 b c]       *[a 2 b 1 c]
34 ::    *[a 8 b c]       *[a 7 [[7 [0 1] b] 0 1] c]
35 ::    *[a 9 b c]       *[a 7 c 2 [0 1] 0 b]
36 ::    *[a 10 [b c] d]  *[a 8 c 7 [0 3] d]
37 ::    *[a 10 b c]      *[a c]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these cases just resolves to another Nock computation, in which each pattern matched on the left appears no more than once on the right. I.e., it’s a macro. But what do the macros do? Let’s work through them, from easiest to hardest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;_37&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt; (37)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second case of 10 is so easy it’s puzzling:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;37 ::    *[a 10 b c]      *[a c]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For any &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, the formula &lt;code&gt;[10 b c]&lt;/code&gt; seems to be perfectly equivalent to the formula &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;. But why? Why would we say &lt;code&gt;[10 b c]&lt;/code&gt; when we could just say &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is that &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt; is a hint to the interpreter. It’s true that &lt;code&gt;[10 b c]&lt;/code&gt; has to be &lt;em&gt;semantically&lt;/em&gt; equivalent to &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;, but it doesn’t have to be &lt;em&gt;practically&lt;/em&gt; equivalent. Since whatever information is in &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is discarded, a practical interpreter is free to ignore it, or to use it in any way that does not affect the results of the computation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;_4&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;7&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;7&lt;/code&gt; is our next easiest macro:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;33 ::    *[a 7 b c]       *[a 2 b 1 c]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Informally, the formula &lt;code&gt;[7 b c]&lt;/code&gt; composes the formulas &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;. To use a bit of math notation, if &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;[7 b c]&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;d(a) == c(b(a))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s see how this works by applying some reductions to the definition of &lt;code&gt;7&lt;/code&gt;, and producing a simpler definition that doesn’t look like a macro:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[a 2 b 1 c]

    &amp;lt;&amp;lt;27 ::    *[a 2 b c]       *[*[a b] *[a c]]&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

*[*[a b] *[a 1 c]]

    &amp;lt;&amp;lt;26 ::    *[a 1 b]         b&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

*[*[a b] c]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we can write a revised line 33, perhaps slightly clearer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;33r::    *[a 7 b c]       *[*[a b] c]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;_5&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;8&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;8&lt;/code&gt; looks slightly horrible but you shouldn’t fear it at all:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;34 ::    *[a 8 b c]       *[a 7 [[7 [0 1] b] 0 1] c]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this even mean? Let’s go through the same process of reducing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[a 7 [[7 [0 1] b] 0 1] c]

  &amp;lt;&amp;lt;33r::    *[a 7 b c]       *[*[a b] c]&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

*[*[a [7 [0 1] b] 0 1] c]

  &amp;lt;&amp;lt;23 ::    *[a [b c] d]     [*[a b c] *[a d]]&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

*[[*[a 7 [0 1] b] *[a 0 1]] c]

  &amp;lt;&amp;lt;33r::    *[a 7 b c]       *[*[a b] c]&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

*[[*[*[a 0 1] b] *[a 0 1]] c]

  &amp;lt;&amp;lt;25 ::    *[a 0 b]         /[b a]&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

*[[*[a b] a] c]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So our revised rule 34:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;34r::    *[a 8 b c]       *[[*[a b] a] c]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this actually do? Well, look at it. It evaluates the formula &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; with the cell of &lt;code&gt;*[a b]&lt;/code&gt; and the original subject &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;. In other words, in math notation, if &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;[8 b c]&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;d(a) == c([b(a) a])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why? Suppose, for the purposes of &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;, we need not just &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, but some intermediate noun computed from &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; that will be useful in &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;’s calculation. We apply &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; with a new subject that’s a cell of the intermediate value and the old subject - not at all unlike pushing a new variable on the stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For extra credit, a good question to ask yourself: why do we need to write &lt;code&gt;[7 [0 1] b]&lt;/code&gt; and not just &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;_36&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt; (36)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now understand all the moving parts we need to figure out the other reduction of &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;36 ::    *[a 10 [b c] d]  *[a 8 c 7 [0 3] d]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reducing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[a 8 c 7 [0 3] d]

  &amp;lt;&amp;lt;34r::    *[a 8 b c]       *[[*[a b] a] c]&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

*[[*[a c] a] [7 [0 3] d]]

  &amp;lt;&amp;lt;33r::    *[a 7 b c]       *[*[a b] c]&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

*[*[[*[a c] a] 0 3] d]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve assimilated a bit of Nock already, you may feel the temptation to reduce this to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[a d]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;since it would be very reasonable to think that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[[*[a c] a] 0 3]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is just &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;. And it seems to be - given the semantics of 8 as we’ve explained them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s a problem, which is that &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; might not terminate. If &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; terminates, this reduction is correct. Otherwise it’s not. So the best we can do is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;36r::    *[a 10 [b c] d]  *[*[[*[a c] a] 0 3] d]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt; in either case is a hint. If &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;[10 x y]&lt;/code&gt; is an atom, we reduce line 37 and &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is simply discarded. Otherwise, &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is a cell &lt;code&gt;[b c]&lt;/code&gt;; &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is discarded, but &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; is computed as a formula and its result is discarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effectively, this mechanism lets us feed both static and dynamic information into the interpreter’s hint mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;_6&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;6&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;6&lt;/code&gt; certainly looks intimidating:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;32 ::    *[a 6 b c d]     *[a 2 [0 1] 2 [1 c d] [1 0] 2 [1 2 3] [1 0] 4 4 b]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could explain &lt;code&gt;6&lt;/code&gt; as a reduction sequence. But it’s a long one. Instead, let’s invent another operator which makes &lt;code&gt;6&lt;/code&gt; easy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;   ::    $[0 b c]         b
   ::    $[1 b c]         c&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we can restate &lt;code&gt;6&lt;/code&gt; quite compactly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;32r::    *[a 6 b c d]     *[a $[*[a b] c d]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;6&lt;/code&gt; stands revealed as the humble if-then-else. Nock &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This excuse for an explanation may not satisfy everyone. A good exercise is to check that &lt;code&gt;6&lt;/code&gt; as defined &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; has these properties - and can’t be simplified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;_7&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt; is an audacious mystery:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;35 ::    *[a 9 b c]       *[a 7 c 2 [0 1] 0 b]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll reduce &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt; but not explain it. When we use it in an example, it’ll be obvious what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[a 7 c 2 [0 1] 0 b]]

  &amp;lt;&amp;lt;33r::    *[a 7 b c]       *[*[a b] c]&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

*[*[a c] 2 [0 1] 0 b]]

  &amp;lt;&amp;lt;27 ::    *[a 2 b c]       *[*[a b] *[a c]]&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

*[*[*[a c] [0 1]] *[*[a c] 0 b]]

  &amp;lt;&amp;lt;25 ::    *[a 0 b]         /[b a]&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

*[*[a c] *[*[a c] 0 b]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;35r::    *[a 9 b c]       *[*[a c] *[*[a c] 0 b]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a really fine instinctive sense of Nock, you might understand what &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt; is for. Otherwise, don’t worry for now.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;urbit-is-easy-ch1.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prev&lt;/strong&gt;: Setup&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;urbit-is-easy-ch3.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt;: Nock Is Easy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What one fool can do, another can”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(Ancient Simian proverb)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve installed Arvo, let’s learn Nock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of Nock as a kind of functional assembly language. It’s not like assembly language in that it’s directly executed by the hardware. It is like assembly language in that (a) everything in Urbit executes as Nock; (b) you wouldn’t want to program directly in Nock; and (c) learning to program directly in Nock is a great way to start understanding Urbit from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as Unix runs C programs by compiling them to assembler, Urbit runs Hoon programs by compiling them to Nock. You could try to learn Hoon without learning Nock. But just as C is a thin wrapper over the physical CPU, Hoon is a thin wrapper over the Nock virtual machine. It’s a tall stack made of thin layers, which is much easier to learn a layer at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And unlike most fundamental theories of computing, there’s really nothing smart or interesting about Nock. Of course, in a strictly formal sense, all of computing is math. But that doesn’t mean it needs to feel like math. Nock is a simple mechanical device and it’s meant to feel that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;specification&quot;&gt;Specification&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the Nock spec. It may look slightly intimidating, but at least it isn’t long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, you can’t just look at this and tell what it’s doing. But at least there are only 39 lines of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1  ::    A noun is an atom or a cell.
2  ::    An atom is a natural number.
3  ::    A cell is an ordered pair of nouns.
4  ::
5  ::    nock(a)          *a
6  ::    [a b c]          [a [b c]]
7  ::
8  ::    ?[a b]           0
9  ::    ?a               1
10 ::    +[a b]           +[a b]
11 ::    +a               1 + a
12 ::    =[a a]           0
13 ::    =[a b]           1
14 ::    =a               =a
15 ::
16 ::    /[1 a]           a
17 ::    /[2 a b]         a
18 ::    /[3 a b]         b
19 ::    /[(a + a) b]     /[2 /[a b]]
20 ::    /[(a + a + 1) b] /[3 /[a b]]
21 ::    /a               /a
22 ::
23 ::    *[a [b c] d]     [*[a b c] *[a d]]
24 ::
25 ::    *[a 0 b]         /[b a]
26 ::    *[a 1 b]         b
27 ::    *[a 2 b c]       *[*[a b] *[a c]]
28 ::    *[a 3 b]         ?*[a b]
29 ::    *[a 4 b]         +*[a b]
30 ::    *[a 5 b]         =*[a b]
31 ::
32 ::    *[a 6 b c d]     *[a 2 [0 1] 2 [1 c d] [1 0] 2 [1 2 3] [1 0] 4 4 b]
33 ::    *[a 7 b c]       *[a 2 b 1 c]
34 ::    *[a 8 b c]       *[a 7 [[7 [0 1] b] 0 1] c]
35 ::    *[a 9 b c]       *[a 7 c 2 [0 1] 0 b]
36 ::    *[a 10 [b c] d]  *[a 8 c 7 [0 3] d]
37 ::    *[a 10 b c]      *[a c]
38 ::
39 ::    *a               *a&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bear in mind: this is pseudocode. It is neither Nock nor Hoon. Strictly speaking, it’s really just English. All formal systems resolve to informal language at the very bottom. What’s important is just that no two reasonable people can read the spec to mean two different things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sounds&quot;&gt;Sounds&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In characteristic Urbit style, we got tired of three or four-syllable pronunciations of ASCII punctuation characters and assigned them all standard one-syllable names. We’ll meet the rest later, but the ones we use in Nock:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;`$`   buc
`/`   fas
`+`   lus
`(`   pel
`)`   per
`[`   sel
`]`   ser
`*`   tar
`=`   tis
`?`   wut&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nouns&quot;&gt;Nouns&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at the data model first - lines 1-3 above. Ideally, you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; look at this and just tell what it’s doing. But let’s explain it a little anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An atom is a natural number - ie, an unsigned integer. Nock does not limit the size of atoms, or know what an atom means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, the atom 97 might mean the number 97, or it might mean the letter ‘a’ (ASCII 97). A very large atom might be the number of grains of sand on the beach - or it might be a GIF of your children playing on the beach. Typically when we represent strings or files as atoms, the first byte is the low byte. But even this is just a convention. An atom is an atom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cell is an ordered pair of any two nouns - cell or atom. We group cells with square brackets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[1 1]
[34 45]
[[3 42] 12]
[[1 0] [0 [1 99]]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep our keyboards from wearing out, line 6 tells us that brackets group to the right:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;6  ::    [a b c]           [a [b c]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So instead of writing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[2 3]
[2 [6 7]]
[2 [6 [14 15]]]
[2 [6 [[28 29] [30 31]]]]
[2 [6 [[28 29] [30 [62 63]]]]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we can write&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[2 3]
[2 6 7]
[2 6 14 15]
[2 6 [28 29] 30 31]
[2 6 [28 29] 30 62 63]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this notational convenience is hardly rocket science, it’s surprising how confusing it can be, especially if you have a Lisp background. Lisp’s “S-expressions” are very similar to nouns, except that Lisp has multiple types of atom, and Lisp’s syntax automatically adds list terminators to groups. So in Lisp&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#39;(2 6 7)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is a shorthand for&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#39;(2 6 7 . nil)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and the equivalent noun is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[2 6 7 0]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or, of course,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[2 [6 [7 0]]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rules&quot;&gt;Rules&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Nock program is given meaning by a process of reduction. To compute &lt;code&gt;Nock(x)&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is any noun, we step through the rules from the top down, find the first left-hand side that matches &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, and reduce it to the right-hand side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right away we see line 5:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;5  ::    Nock(a)           *a&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we use variable names, like &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, in the pseudocode spec, we simply mean that the rule fits for any noun &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So &lt;code&gt;Nock(x)&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;*x&lt;/code&gt;, for any noun &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;. And how do we reduce &lt;code&gt;*x&lt;/code&gt;? Looking up, we see that lines 23 through 39 reduce &lt;code&gt;*x&lt;/code&gt; - for different patterns of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, suppose our &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;[5 1 6]&lt;/code&gt;. Stepping downward through the rules, the first one that matches is line 26:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;26 ::    *[a 1 b]        b&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Line 26 tells us that when reducing any noun of the form &lt;code&gt;[a 1
b]&lt;/code&gt;, the result is just &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;. So &lt;code&gt;*[5 1 6]&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;6&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a more complicated example, try&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[[19 42] [0 3] 0 2]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first rule it matches is line 23:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;23 ::    *[a [b c] d]     [*[a b c] *[a d]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;since &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;[19 42]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;[0 2]&lt;/code&gt;. So this reduces to a new computation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[*[[19 42] 0 3] *[[19 42] 0 2]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each side of this matches rule 25:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;25 ::    *[a 0 b]         /[b a]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we have&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[/[3 [19 42]] /[2 [19 42]]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we explain &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;, we’ll see that this is &lt;code&gt;[42 19]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, suppose our &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is just &lt;code&gt;42&lt;/code&gt;. The first rule that matches is the last:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;39 ::    *a               *a&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So &lt;code&gt;*42&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;*42&lt;/code&gt;, which is &lt;code&gt;*42&lt;/code&gt;. Logically, Nock goes into an infinite reduction loop and never terminates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, this is just a clever CS way to specify the simple reality that &lt;code&gt;*42&lt;/code&gt; is an error and makes no sense. An actual interpreter will not spin forever - it will throw an exception outside the computation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;functions&quot;&gt;Functions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve already seen the &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; function (pronounced “tar”), which just means &lt;code&gt;Nock&lt;/code&gt;. This is the main show and we’ll work through it soon, but first let’s explain the functions it uses - &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;equals_&quot;&gt;Equals: &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; (pronounced “tis”, or sometimes “is”) tests a cell for equality. &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; means yes, &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; means no:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;12 ::    =[a a]           0
13 ::    =[a b]           1
14 ::    =a               =a&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, testing an atom for equality makes no sense and logically fails to terminate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;depth_&quot;&gt;Depth: &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; (pronounced “wut”) tests whether is a noun is a cell. Again, &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; means yes, &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; means no:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;8  ::    ?[a b]           0
9  ::    ?a               1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This convention is the opposite of old-fashioned booleans, so we try hard to say “yes” and “no” instead of “true” and “false.”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;increment_&quot;&gt;Increment: &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; (pronounced “lus”, or sometimes “plus”) adds 1 to an atom:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;10 ::    +[a b]           +[a b]
11 ::    +a               1 + a&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; works only for atoms, whereas &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; works only for cells, the error rule matches first for &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; and last for &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;address_&quot;&gt;Address: &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; (pronounced “fas”) is a tree address function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;16 ::    /[1 a]           a
17 ::    /[2 a b]         a
18 ::    /[3 a b]         b
19 ::    /[(a + a) b]     /[2 /[a b]]
20 ::    /[(a + a + 1) b] /[3 /[a b]]
21 ::    /a               /a&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This looks way more complicated than it is. Essentially, we define a noun as a binary tree - where each node branches to a left and right child - and assign an address, or &lt;em&gt;axis&lt;/em&gt;, to every element in the tree. The root of the tree is &lt;code&gt;/1&lt;/code&gt;. The left child of every node at &lt;code&gt;/a&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;/2a&lt;/code&gt;; the right child is &lt;code&gt;/2a+1&lt;/code&gt;. (Writing &lt;code&gt;(a
+ a)&lt;/code&gt; is just a clever way to write &lt;code&gt;2*a&lt;/code&gt;, while minimizing the set of pseudocode forms.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a complete tree of depth 3, the axis address space looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;         1
    2          3
 4    5     6     7
8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s use the example &lt;code&gt;[[97 2] [1 42 0]]&lt;/code&gt;. So&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/[1 [97 2] [1 42 0]]      [[97 2] [1 42 0]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;because &lt;code&gt;/1&lt;/code&gt; is the root of the tree, ie, the whole noun. Then its left child is &lt;code&gt;/2&lt;/code&gt; (ie, &lt;code&gt;(1 + 1)&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/[2 [97 2] [1 42 0]]      [97 2]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And its right child is &lt;code&gt;/3&lt;/code&gt; (ie, &lt;code&gt;(1 + 1 + 1)&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/[3 [97 2] [1 42 0]]      [1 42 0]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And delving into &lt;code&gt;/3&lt;/code&gt;, we see &lt;code&gt;/(3 + 3)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(3 + 3 + 1)&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/[6 [97 2] [1 42 0]]      1
/[7 [97 2] [1 42 0]]      [42 0]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this seems like rocket science, the problem may be that you’re too smart to understand Nock. Forget everything you learned in school and start over from line 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also fun to build nouns in which every atom is its own axis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1
[2 3]
[2 6 7]
[[4 5] 6 7]
[[4 5] 6 14 15]
[[4 5] [12 13] 14 15]
[[4 [10 11]] [12 13] 14 15]
[[[8 9] [10 11]] [12 13] 14 30 31]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve spent enough time programming in Urbit, you’ll know these axes in your dreams. No - really.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;urbit-is-easy-ch2.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt;: Intro To Nock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tlön is surely a labyrinth, but it is a labyrinth devised by men, a labyrinth destined to be deciphered by men.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prepare_your_computer&quot;&gt;Prepare your computer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urbit runs on Unix machines only. It depends on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gmp&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;libsigsegv&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;openssl&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;libssl-dev (Linux only)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;ncurses (Linux only)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently we support OSX, Linux (not all distributions have been tested) and *BSD. There are no instructions for BSD, because only people with a serious clue run BSD. Intrepid ninjas may attempt ports to other OSes. If you’re not an intrepid ninja, try a VM (eg, VirtualBox).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;configure_os_x&quot;&gt;Configure OS X&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have XCode? Type &lt;code&gt;gcc&lt;/code&gt;. If it says &lt;code&gt;no input files&lt;/code&gt;, you have XCode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, install XCode: &lt;code&gt;https://developer.apple.com/xcode/&lt;/code&gt;, with the command line tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install dependencies - Do you have Homebrew? Type &lt;code&gt;brew&lt;/code&gt;. If it does something, you have Homebrew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, &lt;code&gt;ruby -e &amp;quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; will install it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And follow up with &lt;code&gt;brew install gmp libsigsegv openssl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will ask you for the root password, which ideally you know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macports? Type &lt;code&gt;port&lt;/code&gt;. If it does something, you have Macports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise go &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macports.org/install.php&quot; title=&quot;here&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then &lt;code&gt;sudo port install gmp libsigsegv openssl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter your root password at the prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;configure_linux_ubuntu_or_debian&quot;&gt;Configure Linux (Ubuntu or Debian)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install libgmp3-dev libsigsegv-dev openssl libssl-dev libncurses5-dev git make exuberant-ctags&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;configure_linux_aws&quot;&gt;Configure Linux (AWS)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo yum --enablerepo epel install gcc git gmp-devel openssl-devel ncurses-devel libsigsegv-devel ctags&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;get_the_source&quot;&gt;Get the source&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A. Download and unzip &lt;code&gt;https://github.com/urbit/urbit/archive/master.zip&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;B. &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/urbit/urbit.git&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;set_up_your_enviroment&quot;&gt;Set up your enviroment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; to the unpacked Urbit directory you just created. If this works, &lt;code&gt;ls urb&lt;/code&gt; should show:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;urbit.pill  zod/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great! Now, let’s do some dirty Unix stuff to set up your environment. If you know what this is doing, feel free to do it right. Otherwise:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo &amp;quot;export URBIT_HOME=`pwd`/urb&amp;quot; &amp;gt;&amp;gt;~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make sure this worked,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo $URBIT_HOME&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;should show &lt;code&gt;/urb&lt;/code&gt; within the current directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;build&quot;&gt;Build&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;. Sometimes things are just easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;run&quot;&gt;Run&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;bin/vere -c mypier&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;mypier&lt;/code&gt; is a directory that doesn’t yet exist. All your state (an append-only log and a memory checkpoint) will live in this directory. Its name doesn’t matter and is not visible internally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;pier&lt;/em&gt; is an Urbit virtual machine that hosts one or more Urbit identities, or &lt;em&gt;ships&lt;/em&gt;. When you run &lt;code&gt;vere -c&lt;/code&gt;, it automatically creates a 128-bit ship, or &lt;code&gt;submarine&lt;/code&gt;. Your name (a hash of a randomly-generated public key) will look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~machec-binnev-dordeb-sogduc--dosmul-sarrum-faplec-nidted&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First you’ll see a string of messages like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;vere: urbit home is /Users/cyarvin/Documents/src/u3/urb
loom: mapped 1024MB
time: ~2013.9.1..03.57.11..4935
ames: on localhost, UDP 63908.
generating 2048-bit RSA pair...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then it’ll pause a little, ‘cause this is slow, and then&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;saving passcode in /Users/cyarvin/.urbit/~magsut-hopful.txt
(for real security, write it down and delete the file...)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and, then, if the network gods are happy, your submarine will start pulling down Arvo files:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; + /~machec-binnev-dordeb-sogduc--dosmul-sarrum-faplec-nidted/main/1/bin/ticket/hoon
 + /~machec-binnev-dordeb-sogduc--dosmul-sarrum-faplec-nidted/main/1/bin/reset/hoon
 + /~machec-binnev-dordeb-sogduc--dosmul-sarrum-faplec-nidted/main/1/bin/ye/hoon
 + /~machec-binnev-dordeb-sogduc--dosmul-sarrum-faplec-nidted/main/1/bin/ls/hoon&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and the like. You’ll see a couple pages of this stuff. Don’t worry too much about the details right now. Finally, you’ll get the Arvo shell prompt (which is also a Hoon REPL):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~machec-binnev-dordeb-sogduc--dosmul-sarrum-faplec-nidted/try=&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;register&quot;&gt;Register&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, you need to decide whether a mere submarine is enough for you right now. This monicker is a mouthful. You can stick with it (for now), but you’re going to need a wider xterm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which might be fine! However, please note that just by sending a simple email, you can get a much better ship - a &lt;code&gt;destroyer&lt;/code&gt;, with a nice short name like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just email &lt;code&gt;urbit@urbit.org&lt;/code&gt;, with your submarine in the subject. We’ll send you destroyers - not one, but &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt;. Yes, two! Tell us something cool in the body, and we’ll send you even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a destroyer, you need to configure it. Otherwise, just stretch that xterm wide and skip to section 1.2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your destroyers will arrive in the form of &lt;code&gt;[ship ticket]&lt;/code&gt; pairs. Let’s say one of your ships is &lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc&lt;/code&gt; and its ticket is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~ribdyr-famtem-larrun-figtyd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(What are these strings, anyway? Just random unsigned integers, rendered in Hoon’s syllabic base, &lt;code&gt;@p&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new life awaits you on the off-world colonies! To begin, just type at the prompt:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;:begin ~waclux-tomwyc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and follow the directions. When the script completes, hit return and you’ll be the &lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc&lt;/code&gt; you wanted to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;play_with_arvo&quot;&gt;Play with Arvo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all went well, you now have a nice short prompt:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all did not go well (send us another email), or you’re just too impatient to wait for your destroyer, you have a big long prompt. Which is fine, really, just ugly - and all these exercises will still work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;example_commands&quot;&gt;Example commands&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s try a few quick things to stretch your fingers. Type these command lines and you should see the matching results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; &amp;quot;hello, world&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;hello, world&amp;quot;

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; (add 2 2)
4

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :hello %world
&amp;quot;hello, world.&amp;quot;

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :cat /=main=/bin/hello/hoon
::
::  /=main=/bin/hello/hoon
::
|=  *
|=  [planet=@ta ~]
^-  bowl
:_  ~  :_  ~
:-  %%
!&amp;gt;(&amp;quot;hello, {(trip planet)}.&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did you just do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One, you used Arvo as a Hoon REPL to print the constant &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;hello,
world&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;, which is a fancy way to write the Nock noun&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[104 101 108 108 111 44 32 119 111 114 108 100 0]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two, you called the Hoon &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; function to see that two plus two is four. Math seems to work the same on the off-world colonies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three, you ran the Arvo application &lt;code&gt;:hello&lt;/code&gt; with the argument &lt;code&gt;%world&lt;/code&gt;, which is just a fancy way to write the atom &lt;code&gt;431.316.168.567&lt;/code&gt; (or, for non-Germans, &lt;code&gt;431,316,168,567&lt;/code&gt;). You might recognize it better as &lt;code&gt;0x64.6c72.6f77&lt;/code&gt; - the ASCII characters in LSB first order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Is Urbit German? Sadly, no. But all our noun print formats are URL-safe, which dot is and comma isn’t.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you (4) used the Arvo application :cat to print the Hoon file&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/=main=/bin/hello/hoon&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which, supposing your current date is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~2013.9.1..04.38.31..f259&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(ie, September 1, 2013 at 4:38:31 GMT/LS25 plus 0xf259/65536 seconds), is equivalent to the global path&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/~waclux-tomwyc/main/~2013.8.23..04.38.31..f259/bin/hello/hoon&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which anyone in Urbit can, see and even use - but we’re getting ahead of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;control_characters&quot;&gt;Control characters&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, what we’ve seen is that Arvo is a dangerous and powerful operating system which if handled improperly can cause serious injury or loss of life. We exaggerate. Slightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you need to know is how to control this tool. Try your arrow keys - you’ll see that Arvo has traditional Unix history editing. Up and down, left and right work, as do the simple emacs controls:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;^A  go to beginning of line
^B  left arrow
^D  delete next character
^E  go to end of line
^F  right arrow
^K  kill to end of line
^L  clear the screen
^R  search through history
^U  kill the whole line
^Y  yank (restore from kill ring)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t expect any other emacs (or even readline - this is not readline, it’s internal to Arvo) commands to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also some special control keys specific to Arvo. It’s a good idea to learn these first so that you feel in, um, control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we’ll quit out of an infinite loop with &lt;code&gt;^C&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :infinite&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you hit return at the end of this line, Arvo will appear to hang. Do not be alarmed! This is not a bug - it means that we’ve started running our infinite loop before printing the next console prompt. Simply hit &lt;code&gt;^C&lt;/code&gt;, and you’ll see&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;! intr
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :infinite&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(There may be some stacktrace stuff before the &lt;code&gt;! intr&lt;/code&gt;, depending on whether your kernel was compiled with debugging.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hit &lt;code&gt;^U&lt;/code&gt; to delete the line and escape from infinity. Arvo is a deterministic OS; you interrupted it while processing an event that would never terminate. It returns to the state it was in before you hit return - as if nothing had ever happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re probably used to using nondeterministic, preemptive OSes, in which the difference between a waiting task and an executing event isn’t apparent to the user. Since Arvo is not preemptive, it has two very different states: waiting and working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Arvo is working, &lt;code&gt;^C&lt;/code&gt; cancels the event it’s working on. This event never happened. Don’t worry, nothing bad will happen to your computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Arvo is waiting, use &lt;code&gt;^D&lt;/code&gt; to end the current task, which is the task that’s currently prompting you. If there is a live prompt and the cursor is not at the end, &lt;code&gt;^D&lt;/code&gt; will delete the current character - as in Unix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try this by running&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :begin

Do you have a ship and a ticket? yes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then hit &lt;code&gt;^D&lt;/code&gt; and you’ll be back to the command prompt (which, unlike in Unix, is not a task itself, but part of the OS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t always want to kill the prompting task. We often want to switch between tasks, or between tasks and the command line. Sort of like switching between windows, except in a command line. We do this with &lt;code&gt;^X&lt;/code&gt;. Try&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :begin

Do you have a ship and a ticket? yes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But hit &lt;code&gt;^X&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;^D&lt;/code&gt;. You’ll get a prompt again. Use it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :begin

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :hello %world
&amp;quot;hello, world.&amp;quot;
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hit &lt;code&gt;^X&lt;/code&gt; again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :begin

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :hello %world
&amp;quot;hello, world.&amp;quot;
Do you have a ship and a ticket? yes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, hit &lt;code&gt;^C&lt;/code&gt; to kill the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s one more magic control key that switches your whole reality. This is &lt;code&gt;^W&lt;/code&gt;, which switches between the ships in a pier. Do you have multiple ships in your pier? Sure - you still have your old submarine. Hit &lt;code&gt;^W&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~machec-binnev-dordeb-sogduc--dosmul-sarrum-faplec-nidted/try=&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hit &lt;code&gt;^W&lt;/code&gt; again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Arvo is a single-level store. Since it’s not the ’70s anymore and disk is cheap, everything you do is saved for ever. (In fact, it’s saved in two ways - as a memory image and an event log - so you, or the government if they haz your filez, can repeat every computation you’ve every performed.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the current prompt is just the shell prompt, &lt;code&gt;^D&lt;/code&gt; on an empty line will log out - as in Unix:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt;
oxford:~/urbit; pwd
/Users/cyarvin/urbit
oxford:~/urbit; echo &amp;quot;hello, world&amp;quot;
hello, world
oxford:~/urbit;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you can restart and be right back where you were - just run &lt;code&gt;vere&lt;/code&gt; without &lt;code&gt;-c&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;oxford:~/urbit; bin/vere mypier
vere: urbit home is /Users/cyarvin/urb
loom: loaded 9MB
time: ~2013.9.1..17.23.05..0cc1
ames: on localhost, UDP 60342.
http: live on 8080
rest: checkpoint to event 383
rest: old 0v1c.gkr1o, new 0v10.m4gdu
---------------- playback complete----------------
waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use your arrow keys and you’ll see your history is still there. Arvo is indestructible and can be shut down however you like without losing data. Also, starting a new task while an old one is still running will kill the old one safely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don’t try to operate the same ship on two Unix hosts at the same time. This will confuse everyone, including yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;system_administration&quot;&gt;System administration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we make changes to Hoon or Arvo (we never make changes to Nock) and you need to update your ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two steps to updating. You need to get the new files, and you need to install them. To get them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :update
: /~waclux-tomwyc/arvo/2/hoon/hoon
: /~waclux-tomwyc/arvo/2/dill/hoon
: /~waclux-tomwyc/arvo/2/batz/hoon&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To install them (the simplest, slowest, most general way):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :reset

%reset-start
%reset-parsed
%reset-compiled
%hoon-load
[%tang /~waclux-tomwyc/arvo/~2013.11.26..20.29.15..090f/zuse ~tirnux-latwex]
[%vane %a /~waclux-tomwyc/arvo/~2013.11.26..20.29.15..090f/ames ~tolryn-watret]
[%vane %b /~waclux-tomwyc/arvo/~2013.11.26..20.29.15..090f/batz ~donfex-ladsem]
[%vane %c /~waclux-tomwyc/arvo/~2013.11.26..20.29.15..090f/clay ~picsug-mitref]
[%vane %d /~waclux-tomwyc/arvo/~2013.11.26..20.29.15..090f/dill ~dilpex-laptug]
[%vane %e /~waclux-tomwyc/arvo/~2013.11.26..20.29.15..090f/eyre ~forbur-disben]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of your state, including running tasks, will be unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chat&quot;&gt;Chat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, fine. You’re a long way from being an Arvo ninja. But - you’re ready for the two most important uses of Urbit right now. One, coding. Two, chatting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start coding, read the next chapter. To start chatting, simply type&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :chat
&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and type &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; for help.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Hi Zod! or basic Urbit tunneling</title>

   <updated>2013-10-08T00:00:00-07:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One bug, or really minor misfeature, in Urbit’s networking - not the evil :update bug, possibly aka “ok/not responding,” which remains my main quarry today, but one I had to investigate on the way to it - is that it’s all very well and good to punch a NAT hole, but a lot of routers - for I guess understandable reasons - like to heal the hole up relatively quickly. As in, a minute or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally this means you’re (a) totally disconnected from the Internets and Urbit too, (b) when you return, it will be with a different 48-bit address, and (c) returning means you need to re-establish your hierarchical route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two ways a ship talks to another ship. Actually, there are three. In A, my ship knows your ship’s 48-bit UDP address (ie, IPv4+port). (Like everywhere on the internets, IPv6 is perfectly supported in theory.) In B, my ship &lt;em&gt;thinks it might&lt;/em&gt; know your ship’s address. In C, it knows it doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In C, it forwards through the hierarchy, which for now at present every destroyer is ~doznec through ~zod. In A, it sends a direct packet. In B - the state I enter when I’ve received a &lt;em&gt;forwarded&lt;/em&gt; packet from you, not knowing whether I can send back through the hole - because it is not a tunnel from you to me, but from you to the first ship, probably ~doznec, on the hierarchical path from you to me - it sends &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as one party in the conversation can have its tunnels forwarded (“full cone NAT”), we can converge on a direct conversation with both ships in state C (“STUN”). Otherwise, we end up with the dramatically inferior perma-forwarded TURN. Earlier in the summer it was the major cause of Urbit flakage, but NAT traversal seems to work okay now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With one exception. If I forward to ~doznec, how does the packet then get to you? ~doznec needs a valid 48-bit UDP address for you, which was the address you used to talk to it. (The #1 newbie Unix network programming question: what system call do I use to get my own IP address()? There are a lot of ways to do it, all bad. The answer is that you shouldn’t depend on your own IP address - and to the world, your address is where they see your packets coming from.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of us are old and some of us who are old worked with old people when we were young. I remember in the early ’90s, when I was working on interactive TV, this incredibly ancient person was in the office for some reason - probably looking for the Medicare clinic - and he explained that he’d worked on Telex. Not everyone in the room knew what Telex was, so he explained it. “Telex,” he said, “was the information superhighway when it was paved with gravel.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, there’s certainly &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; asphalt on the Internets, but… in a network paved with gravel, there is no way to keep your hole up but continuous active pinging. As a result, on a bad network your connectivity can only be restored by a trivial communication up the hierarchy - ie, :hi ~zod. The reason this isn’t done automatically is just that functionality of this type is currently in the process of migrating out of the kernel into userspace. So, while Urbit remains in the NICU… doing it manually never ever hurts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I welcome peoples’ opinions on the right &lt;em&gt;period&lt;/em&gt; for this keepalive. Is 2 min short enough? Ya think? I am anything but an expert here&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Urbit, from the NICU to ops Week</title>
   <link href="http://urbit.org/2013/10/06/nicu.html"/>
   <updated>2013-10-06T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://urbit.org/2013/10/06/nicu</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;(TLDR: to keep using Urbit, delete all your pre-10/6 data, git pull the source again, make clean, make, and start over. Your destroyers and tickets will keep working. No, this will not keep happening, though it may happen once or twice again.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urbit has been in the wild for almost two weeks now. Which is crazy. Also, 11.000 people have (according to Vimeo) watched our 10-minute screencast of a command-line session. Apparently in a world of suck, there is a lot of pent-up demand for !suck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What sucks is that we can’t really satisfy this demand right now. Because Urbit still sucks. It was born prematurely and is doing all it can to keep breathing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least we’ve finished the major revision control update that was in the works. Now if your friend &lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen&lt;/code&gt; else has a desk (ie, branch) &lt;code&gt;funky&lt;/code&gt; you want to use, you can&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tasfyn-partyv/try=&amp;gt; :clone /~tomsyt-balsen/funky&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and &lt;code&gt;funky&lt;/code&gt; will be on &lt;code&gt;~tasfyn-partyv&lt;/code&gt; promptly. To update, just use the same command again. It can even merge a bit. Also,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tasfyn-partyv/try=&amp;gt; :update&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;will update the core files you got when your ship was born. And finally, if the Arvo sources change, you can reload everything very simply with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tasfyn-partyv/try=&amp;gt; :reset&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will replace all the Arvo code, including Hoon in Hoon itself, and keep your data intact - even running processes. We told you there was a use for Nock. For a simpler change in a single vane (kernel module), eg &lt;code&gt;%clay&lt;/code&gt; (revision control), just&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tasfyn-partyv/try=&amp;gt; :reload %clay&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bear in mind that for updates in the standard library (&lt;code&gt;%zuse&lt;/code&gt;) to propagate to the shell (&lt;code&gt;%batz&lt;/code&gt;), you need to reload first &lt;code&gt;%zuse&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;%batz&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But - isn’t all this rather premature? Yes, it is! The point of this update was not that anyone needs real revision control in Urbit yet, except of course for Urbit itself. The point is that we need to stabilize our data structures, because Urbit needs to get to continuity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is continuity, exactly? It’s a problem that emerges in a network of single-level stores. No one has built such a network before, to my knowledge, so we’re making it up as we go along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a normal 20th-century OS, there is a hierarchy of ephemeral and persistent data that corresponds to the memory hierarchy on a normal computer. People sometimes talk about DRAM replacements that are naturally persistent, but even if DRAM was persistent, a computer running Unix would still need to be rebooted. In Unix, a TCP socket is ephemeral relative to a process, and a process is ephemeral relative to the filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Arvo there is no ephemeral state anywhere. All state is consistent and indefinitely preserved. This works great when it works perfectly, but it also removes a source of resilience. Essentially the Urbit approach is to operate with high precision and low tolerance, like an American aerospace design. The Unix approach has a more… Soviet… quality. Truly excellent in its own way - don’t get me wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for example, every network connection needs to maintain message sequence numbers on both sides. On Unix, these are bound to your TCP socket, which is doubly ephemeral. In Urbit, they are bound to your public key (certificate iteration). If your ship loses continuity, it needs to generate a new key. This should not happen often - in a healthy ecosystem, never. We know how to compute reliably in the cloud - when was the last time, say, a Google app lost your data?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, unlike in Unix, all our data is structured and typed. When we change the type of state, whether at the kernel or user level, we have to write a type adaptor. We can. So the only excuse for ephemerality is that the underlying computer can fail, which is what redundancy is for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, with an immature system, it’s often a lot easier just to throw away your whole state and reboot the universe. So… we’ve been doing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which we hope to change this week. If you’re using Urbit this week, it’s Ops Week. We’ll be trying to keep the server up and usable for the most trivial task of a social network, chat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, since Urbit is still in the NICU, join us on IRC at #urbit on freenode. Starting Monday morning, it’ll be a big nonstop party with occasional disasters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally… anyone operating the submarines prefixed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~fotdug-milred
~ritheb-latlen
~hidnyr-rivrun
~binnep-lagser&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you’re sending us packets in the old protocol. Please follow these instructions at the top, so we can delete you from our crude manual packet blacklist! Because when we break the world, we really break it&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Not less because in purple I descended&lt;br /&gt;The western day through what you called&lt;br /&gt;The loneliest air, not less was I myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was the ointment sprinkled on my beard?&lt;br /&gt;What were the hymns that buzzed beside my ears?&lt;br /&gt;What was the sea whose tide swept through me there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of my mind the golden ointment rained,&lt;br /&gt;And my ears made the blowing hymns they heard.&lt;br /&gt;I was myself the compass of that sea:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was the world in which I walked, and what I saw&lt;br /&gt;Or heard or felt came not but from myself;&lt;br /&gt;And there I found myself more truly and more strange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Wallace Stevens&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hymn can be full of love, or hate. And the quality of Urbit&amp;#8217;s haters is absurdly high. We cherish each and every one of them. There&amp;#8217;s something sublime about being hit with a perfectly-formed jab. So we&amp;#8217;d like to serve some of the choicest examples for you here, names redacted (we don&amp;#8217;t want to embarrass anyone). Here they are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20130925195007/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2013/09/24/203134/exclusive-john-mcafee-vows-to.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;It&#39;s an image. It&#39;s a link&#39; src=&#39;/assets/tweets.png&#39; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Sadly, though we&amp;#8217;re avid followers of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_24168403/exclusive-john-mcafee-vows-make-internet-impossible-hack&quot;&gt;adventures&lt;/a&gt; of John McAfee, he&amp;#8217;s not involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href=&#39;http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3571697&amp;amp;userid=0&amp;amp;perpage=40&amp;amp;pagenumber=2#post419831292&#39;&gt;outside&lt;/a&gt; the Twitterverse is where&lt;a href=&#39;http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3571697&amp;amp;userid=0&amp;amp;perpage=40&amp;amp;pagenumber=2#post419831292&#39;&gt; things &lt;/a&gt; really start to&lt;a href=&#39;http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3571697&amp;amp;userid=0&amp;amp;perpage=40&amp;amp;pagenumber=1#post419822422&#39;&gt; shine.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; is how you gripe:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this one looks like x86 assembly had a fetal alcohol syndrome love child with haskell&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so are there actually several people involved in this, and if so, what language do they speak amongst themselves?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or do they just gently sway in unison, softly keening&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;++  grip			 ::  extend will  
  |=  [wet=will law=will]  
  ^-  will  
  ?~  wet  law  
  ?:  =(wet law)  law  
  ?^  t.wet  
    ?&amp;gt;((meld i.wet i.t.wet) [i.wet $(wet t.wet)])  
  ?~  law  
    ?&amp;gt;((pier i.wet) [i.wet ~])  
  ?~  q.p.q.i.wet  
    ?&amp;gt;((meld i.wet i.law) [i.wet law])  S&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it&amp;#8217;s like the obfuscated c code contestants and the losethos guy got together and created a monster&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;wait why do I feel moist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And our &lt;a href=&#39;http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2013-09-25&#39;&gt;favorite:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;08:14 * moritz: congratulates the makers on the most elaborate joke he has seen in quite some time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;08:15 * timotimo: imagines being the creator of urbit and seeing it show up on a publically logged irc channel of a similarly insane language design community via a google alert&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because that&amp;#8217;s literally what happened&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;Aint even mad&#39; src=&#39;/assets/notevenmad.jpg&#39; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching the &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/75312418&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; blew my brains out the back of my head. Figuratively of course. Thanks for not letting me get anything productive done for the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Continuity timeframe</title>
   <link href="http://urbit.org/2013/09/25/continuity.html"/>
   <updated>2013-09-25T15:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://urbit.org/2013/09/25/continuity</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thought we’d share the following email that we sent out on the developers mailing list (urbit-dev@googlegroups.org):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Urbit! You’ve been added to this mailing list because you all are now proud owners of one or more destroyers (let us know if you’re not and we’ll remedy that). We’ll be using this list to update all of you with the latest news from the offworld colonies. Presently your subscription settings are at one digest email daily (we have a powerful hatred of listserv-spam). Feel free to change these settings on Google Groups to whatever you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our target date for network continuity is Friday October 4th. At which point the data structures we create will (if we succeed) live forever. We’ll almost certainly do at least one reboot sometime before then, so you’ll have to recreate your destroyers from your keys when we do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, we plan on putting up some actual Hoon doc by then, so you all can, you know, actually learn Hoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll leave you with some Borges: “Stranger and more pure than any hron is, at times, the ur: the object produced through suggestion, educed by hope.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this blog post is not limited to 1000 words (seriously Google) and because I love that quote so damn much, I’ll post the whole thing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the most ancient regions of Tlön, the duplication of lost objects is not infrequent. Two persons look for a pencil; the first finds it and says nothing; the second finds a second pencil, no less real, but closer to his expectations. These secondary objects are called hronir and are, though awkward in form, somewhat longer. Until recently, the hronir were the accidental products of distraction and forgetfulness. It seems unbelievable that their methodical production dates back scarcely a hundred years, but this is what the Eleventh Volume tells us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The methodical fabrication of hronir (says the Eleventh Volume) has performed prodigious services for archaeologists. It has made possible the interrogation and even the modification of the past, which is now no less plastic and docile than the future. Curiously, the hronir of second and third degree - the hronir derived from another hron, those derived from the hron of a hron - exaggerate the aberrations of the initial one; those of fifth degree are almost uniform; those of ninth degree become confused with those of the second; in those of the eleventh there is a purity of line not found in the original. The process is cyclical: the hron of the twelfth degree begins to fall off in quality. Stranger and more pure than any hron is, at times, the ur: the object produced through suggestion, educed by hope.”&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Welcome to Urbit</title>
   <link href="http://urbit.org/2013/09/24/urbit-intro.html"/>
   <updated>2013-09-24T15:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://urbit.org/2013/09/24/urbit-intro</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;But wait - what the hell is Urbit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Urbit’s problems is that we don’t exactly have a word for what Urbit is. If there is such a word, it somehow means both “operating system” and “network protocol,” while somehow also implying “functional” and “deterministic.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only is there no such word, it’s not even clear there &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be one. And if there was, could we even hear it? As Wittgenstein said: if a lion could talk, we would not understand him. But heck, let’s try anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a network protocol, we could call Urbit a “seven-layer protocol” - that is, a protocol that specifies the complete semantics of the general-purpose computer that processes it. As any decent IETF ninja will tell you, this is a very bad idea for all sorts of extremely obvious reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And from the OS perspective, Urbit is yet another slice of userspace crap with the temerity to call itself an “operating system.” Urbit is not actually an OS in the bare-metal sense. It’s a VM that runs on Linux or OS X. Someday it might be so daring as to descend to Xen. Urbit has no interest at all in drivers, peripherals, etc. It is just a UDP transceiver in the cloud. Worst of all - Urbit is not even preemptive. A poser! (Actually all the real work, as in node, is done by libuv.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, this VM is formally isolated from your actual OS. And everything that uses it. Nothing in Urbit can request system services or call existing libraries. So Urbit is not only badly designed and fraudulently hyped. It’s also profoundly useless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well… your browser has been reasonably successful with this restriction. But your browser was never designed to be any kind of OS. To the extent that it’s sort of become an OS, it is specialized for the very undemanding job of being a client. A general-purpose client, which is neat. But not a general-purpose server - which is a much harder problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A general-purpose server is a slab of code that feels totally confident when faced with the problem of storing &lt;em&gt;all your personal and/or corporate data&lt;/em&gt;, across &lt;em&gt;arbitrary functional upgrades&lt;/em&gt;, for &lt;em&gt;all time forever&lt;/em&gt;, while efficiently executing and managing &lt;em&gt;any useful program or programs, transient or persistent&lt;/em&gt;. Yeah, that’s a server OS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, conventionally, this industrial strength slab of code is written with conventional OS techniques involving (a) bare metal and (b) like, semaphores and shit. The kernel alone is like 12 million lines of code. Not that a browser is any much smaller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, 20th-century network computing is the world’s most beautiful wire, between two dumpsters of shit spaghetti. Two &lt;em&gt;completely different&lt;/em&gt; dumpsters. It turns out that with a big enough dumpster of shit spaghetti, you can feed the world. And why not two? Incompatibility creates jobs, you know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and you can have a client without an identity. But you can’t have a &lt;em&gt;server&lt;/em&gt; without an identity. So Urbit has to solve &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; problem. Unless it’s just going to be a Web server. (Urbit is actually a perfectly decent Web server.) Unless it has an actual identity model, your general-purpose server - presumably a &lt;em&gt;network&lt;/em&gt; server - has no network effect. No identity, no network. No network, who the hell cares?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And unlike your ordinary, common or garden Web application server, Urbit does need that network effect. You see, it’s not even our own work. It’s something we found. On an unmarked USB stick by the side of the road three kilometers from Area 51.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think it’s probably still human engineering. First of all, there are no aliens. Second, Urbit uses Unicode. Do the aliens have Unicode? Or SHA-256? &lt;em&gt;Where did Unicode come from, anyway?&lt;/em&gt; And at the I/O level, we see UDP, HTTP, etc. The command line does Emacs keys. At the very least, someone on Earth (or at least &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; Earth) has done some porting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But other than these cosmetic details, there’s not much sign of a connection to ordinary Earth computing. For instance, Urbit isn’t written in any of our Earth languages. It is written in something called Hoon, which is a strict, higher-order, typed functional language - but has nothing in else in common with other Earth languages, functional or not. Hoon does not even use standard PL theory. And its syntax is just as alien, although at least it confines itself to the ASCII plane. (And you probably thought the “A” in “ASCII” stood for “American.”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worse yet, Hoon is not written in anything normal. It’s written in Hoon. To be precise - the Hoon compiler compiles itself to a much simpler automaton, Nock. Besides machine language itself, and its various bytecode homages, there are three simple formal models of computing - Turing machines, lambda calculus, and Chuck Moore. There is also a fourth which no one has ever found useful for anything: combinators. Nock is a combinator automaton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While nowhere near the simplest such automaton known, and certainly not of any &lt;em&gt;theoretical&lt;/em&gt; interest, Nock is so stupid that if you gzip the spec, it’s only 374 bytes. Nock’s only arithmetic operation is increment. So decrement is an &lt;code&gt;O(n)&lt;/code&gt;, operation; add is &lt;code&gt;O(m*n)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly not a practical system. Even if this… &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt;… that sits on top of it was in any way, shape or form remotely sane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why not try it? Heck, why not at least check it out? Strange and foolish dreamers may hie themselves to teh github:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/urbit&quot;&gt;https://github.com/urbit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various people have built and run Urbit on Ubuntu, Homebrew and MacPorts. It’s possible that all these people were stone cold ninjas. Urbit is a pretty cool toy, I think, if you’re a ninja. Unfortunately it is not really ready for ordinary rice farmers. If you can’t resolve build dependencies by hand, we’re sorry. Urbit is probably not yet ready for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where should you run Urbit? Ideally, in the cloud. Urbit can punch a decent NAT hole. It doesn’t like to, though - what does? Bear in mind that your Urbit instance is a single-level store - your state is saved as a log and a checkpoint (as in Redis - except that Redis is both fast and reliable). This will work much better on server hardware. That said, there are plenty of good reasons to keep your servers in the closet with the plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, you need a ticket. Or not. You at least need to decide whether you want a ticket or not. Actually, the answer is simple. You do want one. But you don’t need one - not yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because Urbit, the OS, never depends on Earth semantics, it needs its own network protocol - Ames. Ames is a P2P protocol with its own public-key infrastructure. (Ames is encrypted, but the current cryptosuite, suite A, is worthless snakeoil. Don’t trust it with your Trader Joe receipts.) Ames runs over UDP, and pays as little attention to IP routing as possible. Needless to say, Urbit does not use the DNS at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sling packets on Ames, you need an identity. Needless to say, there are a lot of ways to do distributed cryptographic identity, all of them bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general reason all PKIs suck is called “Zooko’s Triangle.” Your identities can be distributed, secure, or human-meaningful - pick any two. There is no way to solve Zooko’s Triangle. The only way to attack it is to compromise on at least one vertex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see how Urbit works, let’s start with a standard solution. An Urbit identity is called a “ship.” You can launch your own ship by generating a 2048-bit RSA key and hashing it to a 128-bit fingerprint, which is your identity. This trivial design is the basis of all distributed, secure PKIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, an identity should be above all a &lt;em&gt;name&lt;/em&gt;. A 128-bit fingerprint looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    316.931.986.049.624.498.975.974.005.376.666.572.699&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which isn’t a name. For no better reason than the fact that, unless you’re an autistic savant, you are basically a monkey with an overgrown monkey brain. A name is something that fits in a register. Your monkey brain doesn’t have 128-bit registers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose we could use 64-bit fingerprints? At first this seems even less promising. First of all, your monkey brain doesn’t have 64-bit registers, either. Second, at 64 bits, collisions are already a real problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we can solve both these problems. Your monkey brain doesn’t have 64-bit registers. But anything that lets us do 64-bit identities might stretch down to 32 bits. And at 64 or 32 bits, we can’t assign identities by random hash. So we’ll have to find another way of distributing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 32-bit identity - or even a 16-bit identity - will still never be human-meaningful. Perhaps we can make it human-memorable. Meaningful addresses are a nice feature in a social network, but memorable addresses are essential. And if we have memorable addresses, perhaps we can build meaningful names on top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The classic example of a memorable address is a street address. Your street address identifies you precisely, using a name. You have this great brain hardware for remembering names. But what does the name of your street &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt;? Nothing at all, usually. And even if it does mean something, by accident or design, that meaning has nothing at all to do with you. (One of us grew up in Columbia, Maryland, which has street names like “Greek Boy Place.”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So all we need is a simple, tasteful, memorable way to remember 32 bits - and we’re on our way to approximating the Triangle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decimal notation is the worst way of remembering a 32-bit number. IP notation is a little better. Urbit has a typically crude approach: we map every byte to a CVC phoneme, making names like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;   ~tasfyn-partyv
   ~sivbud-barnel
   ~tomsyt-balsen&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These strings, while quite meaningless, are no less memorable than real human names in many a language. Moreover, they form a language of their own, and become more memorable as you use them. And there are 4 billion of them, which (as we’ll see) is almost exactly the right number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how do we distribute them? One obvious solution is a proof of work scheme, as in Bitcoin. Coordinating a global proof-of-work scheme is quite nontrivial, however. Also, there is a second reason to compromise 100% decentralization: packet routing. It might be possible to use a blockchain as a global routing table. It would take some thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, there’s a clue here that the Bitcoin approach just isn’t getting. The limited subspace of short names, within the general space of 128-bit names, is essentially &lt;em&gt;real estate&lt;/em&gt;. There is absolutely no reason, moral or practical, to give this real estate away for free to people whose only contribution is generating CO2 on their GPUs. Mining is not in any way a productive activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather, initially, this real estate belongs to Urbit itself. If Urbit has value, its real estate has value. If Urbit has no value, its so-called real estate is a bunch of worthless bits. Therefore, any value in the real estate can, should, and will be used to bootstrap the system from an economic perspective. Ie, it belongs to and will be captured by Urbit’s developers and/or early adopters. If you find this morally wrong, sorry. You’re probably some kind of a communist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But because Urbit is a free republican society - not (ahem) a fascist corporate dictatorship like Google, Facebook or Twitter - a crucial aspect of launching or transferring a ship is that the decision is irreversible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the master of an Urbit ship, your informal title is cryptographic and &lt;em&gt;allodial&lt;/em&gt; - no one, not the government and certainly not us, can challenge it. Unless the attacker can steal your secrets. In which case, of course, she might as well be you. That’s like Bitcoin too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Bitcoin is money, Urbit is land. (Floating land is still land, if there’s a limited amount of it.) You own both in the same way, by proving you can keep a secret. A Bitcoin is not useful for anything, except selling to a greater fool. (We’re just kidding - we’re huge Bitcoin fans.) But an Urbit ship is directly useful, so long as Urbit itself is useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You fill your Bitcoin wallet either by creating new coins, or buying old ones from Satoshi and his cronies. You build your Urbit fleet by buying ships from us and our cronies. (Don’t ask what we had to do to get them from the aliens. Those aliens are into a lot of strange shit, man.) Ships are transferable, but Urbit is not designed to be a digital currency. Transaction overhead is artificially high. Again, as in real estate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urbit at present is empty and worthless. So 32-bit ships - destroyers - are $0. Launch a 128-bit ship (a submarine) and ask me, ~tasfyn-partyv, for one. We’ll send you one, two, or a dozen. You can be as anonymous as you want, if you’re polite. But, if the network lives, a destroyer price will develop. It will be very low at first, but not zero. Urbit is designed to be free as in speech. It’s not designed to be free as in beer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How, cryptographically, are cloud ships distributed? And how are packets routed? The answer is the same - the prefix hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Urbit’s naval terminology, ships above 64 bits are “submarines.” 64-bit ships are “yachts.” 32-bit, “destroyers.” 16-bit, “cruisers.” 8-bit, “carriers.” This also resembles a feudal hierarchy, so it comes with a feudal terminology. There are 256 imperial carriers, 65.280 royal cruisers, 4.294.901.760 rebel destroyers, uncounted scads of private yachts, and more or less infinitely many rogue submarines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every ship but a submarine has a “will,” or certificate chain - a linked list of “deeds.” The first deed in this list is signed by the ship’s hierarchical prefix, or “flagship.” Mere submarine are independent; carriers create cruisers; cruisers create destroyers; destroyers create yachts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A submarine is the fingerprint of its own public key; a carrier’s fingerprint is predefined in the kernel. Anyone can create any number of 128-bit submarines, whose free and independent society the 64-bit naval hierarchy cannot interfere with. And of course, since Urbit is (a) in the public domain and (b) not patented, anyone can fork Urbit and change the carrier fingerprints. Anyone can also create his own independent and incompatible DNS, but efforts in this direction have not been crowned with great success. In general, the easier it is technically to fork open-source code or an open standard, the less likely a fork is to actually happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An independent ship is an independent reputation. Your flagship hierarchy, though it created your ship, has no control over it - so your reputations are and should be separate. But there are not 2^64 independent reputations in Urbit, only 2^32. Cruisers have no control over the destroyers they create, but yachts have no independence from the destroyers that created them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for this is simple - a destroyer corresponds not to a person, but to any institution with its own independent reputation. Yachts are for users, bots, or other sub-identities of this institution. Each destroyer has 2^32 of them, which is, of course, a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does independence work in practice? By pinning/TOFU. For any deed number, or “life,” the first instance is accepted. Thus when changing secrets, perhaps to transfer a ship, the donor signs a new deed created by the recipient. Once any ship sees this deed, it will never accept another signed by the old owner. Thus, a cruiser cannot sell the same new destroyer twice. Similarly, deed 7 of ~tasfyn-partyv signs deed 8; but no ship which has a deed 8 for ~tasfyn-partyv will either accept deed 7, or any other purported deed 8 which deed 7 later signs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preventing a “double spend” thus depends on propagating the latest deed. For this purpose, the ocean is divided into two kinds of ships: friends and non-friends of the ship being transferred. The ship has a list of its cryptographic partners, or “neighbors,” for which it holds a symmetric key and a routing (IP) address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new owner sends the new deed to all the neighbors, thus locking the old owner out of them. Future new friends will get the new owner’s will the same way they get the new owner’s IP address - by a lookup through the flagship hierarchy. Thus if we update both neighbors and flagship, the old owner is locked out and the new owner is locked in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically, this is very much an imperfect procedure. It relies on social trust to make it effective. For example, a malicious seller could edit his neighbor list before delivering the ship. You probably don’t want to buy a used destroyer from someone you distrust. Of course, the same is true of cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And more broadly, the naval hierarchy can and should provide general administrative support. For one thing, the big ships route your packets, at least when establishing contact with your fellow destroyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So - do you want an Urbit destroyer? You know you do. Moreover, they’re free. Of course, if you are satisfied with a name that looks like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    ~machec-binnev-dordeb-sogduc--dosmul-sarrum-faplec-nidted&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you can keep swimming around Urbit in your submarine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a while, anyway. Because, besides memorability, there is another reason for short names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s neat about short names is that there’s a finite number of them. This is not a bug, but a feature. Essentially, to borrow the thinking of political scientist James Scott, a finite space is &lt;em&gt;governable&lt;/em&gt;. An infinite space is ungovernable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are an infinite number of identities, there is no way for anyone to distinguish between a new user and a banned user. A reputation can be punished by destroying it, but anyone can start again at zero. A parasite whose only reason to use the network is to abuse it can keep coming back for more. An email spammer will never run out of addresses to spam from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IPv4 is a limited space, which almost but doesn’t cure spam. The problem is that IPv4 addresses are neither personal nor property, so there is generally no easy way to punish a spammer as he deserves through IP blacklisting. He is very unlikely to be in any sense the owner of the IP address on his packets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if the email address and the IP address were the same thing, and the present fuzzy economic relationship between the user of an IP address were clear and simple, killing spam would become easy. You spam from a destroyer; you go on a list of spammers; no one will accept your unsolicited messages, ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get around this. You can buy a new destroyer. But the thing is - it costs you &lt;em&gt;money&lt;/em&gt;. You’re not spamming for the fun of it. If a destroyer costs a mere $1, the spam you send from it needs to earn you $1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does not make it trivial for the forces of light to hunt you down and render you into processed meat clippings. But it sure as heck evens the game. Who will win? I guess we’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So do you want an Urbit destroyer? Read the &lt;a href=&quot;/2013/11/18/urbit-is-easy-ch1.html&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; for instructions. Come on, they’re free&lt;/p&gt;</content>
