   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;That is, we can evaluate arbitrary numbers of formulas on the same subject in parallel. Which is pretty cool. But what if we want to run them in series?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expression &lt;code&gt;*[[42 43] [[4 0 3] 1 [0 1]]]&lt;/code&gt; is a good example of how this might work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([42 43] [[4 0 3] 1 [3 0 1]])
[44 [0 1]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wouldn’t it be interesting if we could run [44 3 0 1] through Nock again and end up with &lt;code&gt;*[44 [3 0 1]]&lt;/code&gt; or just &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’d need a recursive operator to do that. Fortunately, we’ve got one, Nock 2:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([42 43] [2 [4 0 3] 1 [3 0 1]])
1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously this is a toy example because we could just do the same thing functionally with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([42 43] [3 4 0 3])
1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Nock 2 also lets us call formulas that live inside our subject:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([[40 43] [4 0 1]] [2 [0 4] [0 3]])
41

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([[40 43] [4 0 1]] [2 [0 5] [0 3]])
44&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is really neat. We did a lot of slicing and dicing of nouns with the formula distribution rule. Nock 2 lets us run those reassembled nouns as expressions. We could think of Nock 2 as being more or less exactly like the distribution rule:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[a [b c] d]          [*[a b c] *[a d]]  &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;except that Nock 2 has an extra &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; meaning we run everything through Nock a second time. So if we have two formulas&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[subject 2 formula1 formula2]          *[*[subject formula1] *[subject formula2]]  &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which we can rewrite as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[a 2 b c]            *[*[a b] *[a c]] &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nock_2&quot;&gt;Nock 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[a 2 b d]            *[*[a b] *[a c]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</content>

   <title>Nock Tutorial&#58; Module 4 (More Formulas)</title>

   <id>http://urbit.org/2014/01/18/mod4</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So we’ve learned how to do some simple operations with Nock. Now we’re going to get a little fancier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To jog your memory, we’ve seen the following operators so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([42 43] [0 1])
[42 43]

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([42 43] [1 0])
[42 43]

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([42 43] [3 0 1])
0

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([42 43] [4 0 2])
43&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These have all had the following pattern in common:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[subject [operator arguments]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;with the atomic operator (0, 1, 3 or 4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if we replaced that atom with a cell? With a formula, even? Let’s try it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*(42 [[0 1] 0 1])
[42 42]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well that’s different. Let’s try another subject:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([42 43] [[0 1] 0 1])
[[42 43] 42 43]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if we change the formulas?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([42 43] [[0 2] 0 1])
[42 42 43]

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([42 43] [[0 2] 0 2])
[42 42]

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([42 43] [[0 1] 0 2])
[[42 43] 42]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like its running both formulas and then just combining the results in a cell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([42 43] [[3 0 1] 3 0 2])
[0 1]

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([42 43] [[3 0 1] 4 0 3])
[0 44]

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([42 43] [[1 [0 1]] 4 0 3])
[[0 1] 44]

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([42 43] [[4 0 3] 1 [0 1]])
[44 [0 1]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yup, the subject is definitely running through both formulas in parallel. The last example seems to do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[[42 43] [4 0 3] 1 [55 73]]         [*[[42 43] [4 0 3]] *[[42 43] 1 [55 73]]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which we can evaluate using Arvo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([42 43] [4 0 3])
44

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([42 43] [1 [0 1]])
[0 1]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or by hand, which is good practice. Open up a blank text file or grab a pen and copy along:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[[42 43] [4 0 3] 1 [0 1]]  [*[[42 43] [4 0 3]] *[[42 43] 1 [0 1]]]

&amp;lt;&amp;lt;  Nock 4:       *[a [4 b]]          +(*[a b]) &amp;gt;&amp;gt;

[+(*[[42 43] 0 3]]) *[[42 43] 1 [0 1]]]

&amp;lt;&amp;lt;  Nock 0:       *[a [0 b]]          /b of a  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;
   
[+(43) *[[42 43] 1 [0 1]]]

&amp;lt;&amp;lt;     +():       +(atom)             1 + atom  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;

[44 *[[42 43] 1 [0 1]]]

&amp;lt;&amp;lt;  Nock 1:       *[a [1 b]]          b  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;

[44 [0 1]] &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([42 43] [[4 0 3] 1 [0 1]])
[44 [0 1]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could write the first line of the reduction more generally as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[subject [formula1] formula2]     [*[subject formula1] *[subject formula2]]   &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is a little long for my taste, since a formula is a cell we can rewrite it as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[a [b c] d e]     [*[a b c] *[a d e]]   &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where a is the subject, [b c] is formula1 and [d e] is formula2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But actually we can simplify this further and just say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[a [b c] d]     [*[a b c] *[a d]]   &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;since d has to be a cell for &lt;code&gt;*[a d]&lt;/code&gt; to evaluate. We really just want to specify what happens when you replace an atomic operator with a cell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s really cool about this rule is that, like the operators, it also chains:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([42 [46 47]] [[0 1] [3 0 1] [0 2]])
[[42 46 47] 0 42]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if we wanted to produce our subject with all the atoms incremented, we could do that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([42 [46 47]] [[4 0 1] [4 0 2] [4 0 3]])
[43 47 48]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can make our chains as long as we like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([42 [46 47]] [[0 1] [3 0 1] [0 2] [3 0 2] [0 3] [3 0 3]])
[[42 46 47] 0 42 1 [46 47] 0]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, we can evaluate arbitrary numbers of formulas on the same subject in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we understand how to slice up nouns in our subject, let’s introduce Nock 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nock 5 is exactly like Nock 3 and Nock 4 in structure, but we’ve saved it for last because it’s easier to understand how to use it, once you know how to distribute formulas. See if you can figure it out from the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([42 42] [5 [0 2] [0 3]])
0

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([42 43] [5 [0 2] [0 3]])
1

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([42 44] [5 [0 2] [0 3]])
1

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([[42 42] [42 42]] [5 [0 2] [0 3]])
0

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([[42 43] [42 43]] [5 [0 2] [0 3]])
0

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([[42 43] [42 43]] [5 [0 4] [0 3]])
1

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([[42 42] [42 42]] [5 [0 2] [0 3]])
0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, Nock 5 is an equality test:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[a 5 b]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if the head and the tail of the cell produced by &lt;code&gt;*[a b]&lt;/code&gt; are the same, then Nock 5 produces 0, if they are different, Nock 5 produces 1:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[a 5 b]              =(*[a b])
=([a a])              0 
=([a !a])              1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code&gt;!a&lt;/code&gt; just means “not a.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if &lt;code&gt;*[a b]&lt;/code&gt; inside &lt;code&gt;=(*[a b])&lt;/code&gt; produces an atom?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([[42 42] [42 42]] [5 [1 1]])    
! exit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we need to add&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;=(atom)              ! exit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to our rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s reduce the last example from above by hand:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[[[42 42] [42 42]] [5 [0 2] [0 3]]]

    *[a 5 b]                =(*[a b])

=(*[[[42 42] [42 42]] [0 2] [0 3]])

    *[a [b c] d]            [*[a b c] *[a d]] 

=([*[[[42 42] [42 42]] [0 2]] *[[[42 42] [42 42]] [0 3]]])

    *[a [0 b]]               /b of a

=([[42 42] *[[[42 42] [42 42]] [0 3]]])

    *[a [0 b]]               /b of a

=([[42 42] [42 42]])

    =([a a])                 0 

1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;formula_distribution&quot;&gt;Formula Distribution:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A formula with a second formula at its head instead of an operator distributes the subject over both formulas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[a [b c] d]          [*[a b c] *[a d]]  &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[b c] is the first formula, d is the second formula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nock_5&quot;&gt;Nock 5&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[a 5 b]              =(*[a b])
=([a a])              0 
=([a b])              1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;exercises&quot;&gt;Exercises:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the above rule, write a formula that reverses the order of the atoms in &lt;code&gt;[42 46 [68 69] 55]&lt;/code&gt; i.e. produces &lt;code&gt;[55 [68 69] 46 42]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put the subject &lt;code&gt;[4 3 7 2 5 1 6]&lt;/code&gt; in order from least to greatest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does &lt;code&gt;*[[42 42] 5 [0 1] [0 3]]&lt;/code&gt; produce a &lt;code&gt;yes&lt;/code&gt; or a &lt;code&gt;no&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write a noun that contains some data (nouns you find interesting) and some code (formulas you find interesting), write an expression with that noun as the subject that produces a single data-noun and a single formula cell. Then use Nock 2 to apply the formula to the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose a subject such that the following expression evaluates&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*(subject [2 [0 5] [0 4] [0 3]])&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;43&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

   <updated>2014-01-18T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://urbit.org/2014/01/18/mod3</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last module we learned how to test whether a noun is an atom or a cell with &lt;code&gt;Nock 3&lt;/code&gt;. Now we’re going to figure out what &lt;code&gt;Nock 4&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Nock 2&lt;/code&gt; do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start playing with &lt;code&gt;Nock 4&lt;/code&gt;, using &lt;code&gt;[[44 45] 46]&lt;/code&gt; as our subject:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*([[44 45] 46] [4 0])
! exit

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*([[44 45] 46] [4 1])
! exit

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*([[44 45] 46] [4 2])
! exit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, this is starting to feel a lot like &lt;code&gt;Nock 3&lt;/code&gt;. Looks like &lt;code&gt;Nock 4&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t like atoms either. Remember that &lt;code&gt;Nock 3&lt;/code&gt; took a cell that was a formula as its argument:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[subject [3 formula]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then depending on what the expression&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[subject formula]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;produced, &lt;code&gt;Nock 3&lt;/code&gt; would return a &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, according to the function &lt;code&gt;?(x)&lt;/code&gt; that we defined:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[a [3 b]]         ?(*[a b])
?(cell)            0
?(atom)            1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume that Nock 4 operates in a similar way. Let’s use the formula &lt;code&gt;[0 n]&lt;/code&gt; to try to apply Nock 4 to different axes in our subject:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*([[44 45] 46] [4 [0 1]])
! exit

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*([[44 45] 46] [4 [0 2]])
! exit

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*([[44 45] 46] [4 [0 3]])
47&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well! That’s blessedly simple then. Watch:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*([[44 45] 46] [0 3])
46

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*([[44 45] 46] [4 [0 3]])
47&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you guess what&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*([[44 45] 46] [4 [0 4]])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;would produce?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you said&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*([[44 45] 46] [4 [0 4]])
45&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then you’re starting to get the hang of this. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, &lt;code&gt;Nock 4&lt;/code&gt; is increment. Nock together your subject and the formula in your argument, and whatever that produces, add 1 to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if &lt;code&gt;*[subject formula]&lt;/code&gt; produces a cell instead of an atom? How do we add &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; to a cell? Simple, we don’t. The sun continues to rise in the east, pigs remain regretfully earthbound, Hell is still rather toasty, and incrementing a cell in Nock produces an ! exit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*([[44 45] 46] [4 [0 2]])
! exit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming we understood how &lt;code&gt;Nock 3&lt;/code&gt; worked, writing dow our pattern for &lt;code&gt;Nock 4&lt;/code&gt; is easy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nock 3:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[a [3 b]]         ?(*[a b])
?(cell)            0
?(atom)            1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nock 4:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[a [4 b]]         +(*[a b])
+(cell)            ! exit
+(atom)            1 + atom&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;+(x)&lt;/code&gt; is, again, just some notation so we can write out both branches of Nock 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting property of Nock 4 is that we can chain it together to increment successive times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*(44 [4 [0 1]])
45

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*(44 [4 [4 [0 4]]])
46

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*(44 [4 [4 [4 [0 4]]]])
47

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*(44 [4 [4 [4 [4 [0 4]]]]])
48

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*(44 [4 [4 [4 [4 [4 [0 4]]]]]])
49&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those brackets are starting to really pile up. Which is making this whole process a lot less legible than we would like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunatley Nock has a notational rule that’ll let us not have to write so many of those brackets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*(44 [4 [4 [4 [4 [4 [0 4]]]]]])
49

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*(44 [4 4 4 4 4 0 4])
49&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woah. That’s a lot cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concisely, Nock considers brackets to group to the right. If you’ll recall from back in module 1:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;A noun is an atom or a cell.
An atom is a natural number.
A cell is an ordered pair of two nouns. I.e. two atoms, two cells, or a cell and an atom.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which means that formally, all nouns in Nock are either singletons (atoms) or cells (pairs). There are no triples, quadruples, or n-tuples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[a b c]
[a b c d]
[a b c d e]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But because a triple like [a b c] doesn’t exist in Nock, but is easier on the eyes, we can map a nested pair onto it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[a b c]         [a [b c]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which means that the Nock interpreter, whenever it sees a triple (or any n-tuple, for n&amp;gt;2), just inserts the needed brackets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s do some more examples to help you get the hang of it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*(44 [4 [4 [4 [4 [4 0 1]]]]])
49

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*(44 [4 [4 [4 [4 4 0 1]]]])
49

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*(44 [4 [4 [4 4 4 0 1]]])
49

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*(44 [4 [4 4 4 4 0 1]])
49

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*(44 [4 4 4 4 4 0 1])
49&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can’t get rid of the last pair though:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*(44 4 4 4 4 4 0 1)
~ &amp;lt;syntax error at [1 18]&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just an artifact of Arvo’s Nock interpreter, which we directly access with the &lt;code&gt;.*&lt;/code&gt; function, pronounced &lt;code&gt;dottar&lt;/code&gt; (dot-star, get it?). &lt;code&gt;.*&lt;/code&gt; takes two arguments, a subject and a formula:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;.*(subject [formula])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for inscrutable reasons, the formula has to be in brackets. As does the subject, if it’s a cell:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*(44 45 [4 4 4 4 4 0 2])
~ &amp;lt;syntax error at [1 9]&amp;gt;

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*([44 45] [4 4 4 4 4 0 2])
49&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s review:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nock_4&quot;&gt;Nock 4:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[a [4 b]]         +(*[a b])
+(cell)            ! exit
+(atom)            1 + atom&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;brackets&quot;&gt;Brackets:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brackets group to the right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[a b c]         [a [b c]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nock_interpreter&quot;&gt;Nock interpreter:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;.*&lt;/code&gt; is pronounced “dottar”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Takes two arguments, subject and formula:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;.*(subject [formula])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;formula must be bracketed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;exercises&quot;&gt;Exercises:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chain together Nock 4 and Nock 3, so that cells produce 2 and atoms produce 3.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Write a formula that always returns the cell [4 0 1].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</content>

   <title>Nock Tutorial&#58; Module 2 (Cells and Formulas)</title>
   <link href="http://urbit.org/2014/01/18/mod2.html"/>
   <updated>2014-01-18T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://urbit.org/2014/01/18/mod2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the last module we learned how to access data inside nouns. Now we’re going to learn what you can do with data. After all, Nock is a computer, so you should be able to, you know, compute things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We mentioned in the last module that Nock has eleven operators, &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; through &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;. We saw &lt;code&gt;Nock 1&lt;/code&gt; in Module 1:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[a [1 b]]                  b&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could describe &lt;code&gt;Nock &lt;/code&gt;1 the constant operator, since it always produces &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; no matter what you put in as a.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have &lt;code&gt;Nock 0&lt;/code&gt;, which lets you refer to the sub-noun at the &lt;code&gt;axis b&lt;/code&gt; of your subject &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[a [0 b]]               /b of a&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to skip &lt;code&gt;Nock 2&lt;/code&gt; in this module and jump straight to &lt;code&gt;Nock 3&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we do, let’s quickly go over three new terms that’ll help us talk about operators:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you have the Nock expression&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[a [1 b]] &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; is the operator, but shouldn’t we have names for what &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; are?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s call &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; the subject, because it’s being subjected to our computation. Poor &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll call &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; an argument, And we’ll call the cell &lt;code&gt;[1 b]&lt;/code&gt; a formula. Diagramming it out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[a [1 b]] 
*[subject [operator argument]]
*[subject formula]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good, now that we’ve got vocab out of the way, let’s get cooking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s use the big noun &lt;code&gt;[[[48 49] 45] [46 47]]&lt;/code&gt; from the last module as our subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*([[[48 49] 45] [46 47]] [3 0])
! exit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uh-oh, Arvo is telling us we just tried to do something indecent and unnatural.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*([[[48 49] 45] [46 47]] [3 1])
! exit

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*([[[48 49] 45] [46 47]] [3 2])
! exit

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*([[[48 49] 45] [46 47]] [3 3])
! exit

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*([[[48 49] 45] [46 47]] [3 4])
! exit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like &lt;code&gt;Nock 3&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t like an atomic argument. Let’s go cellular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*([[[48 49] 45] [46 47]] [3 [0 1]])
0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so at least that does something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s try some more:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*([[[48 49] 45] [46 47]] [3 [0 2]])
0

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*([[[48 49] 45] [46 47]] [3 [0 3]])
0

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*([[[48 49] 45] [46 47]] [3 [0 4]])
0

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*([[[48 49] 45] [46 47]] [3 [0 5]])
1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hold on, aren’t &lt;code&gt;[0 1]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;[0 5]&lt;/code&gt; valid Nock formulas on their own? If &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt; only takes cells, and formulas are cells, maybe it matters what the formula does on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s try that sequence again without &lt;code&gt;Nock 3&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*([[[48 49] 45] [46 47]] [0 1])
[[[48 49] 45] [46 47]]

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*([[[48 49] 45] [46 47]] [0 2])
[[48 49] 45]

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*([[[48 49] 45] [46 47]] [0 3])
[46 47]

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*([[[48 49] 45] [46 47]] [0 4])
[48 49]

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*([[[48 49] 45] [46 47]] [0 5])
45&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of these things is not like the others. Looks like something changes whether the formula &lt;code&gt;[0 n]&lt;/code&gt; refers to an atom or a cell in our subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s see what happens if we run Nock 3 with &lt;code&gt;[0 1]&lt;/code&gt; as its argument and try some different subjects:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*([42 42] [3 [0 1]])
0

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*(42 [3 [0 1]])
1

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*([1 1] [3 [0 1]])
0

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*(1 [3 [0 1]])
1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like that’s &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; for cells and &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; for atoms. Which means that &lt;code&gt;Nock 3&lt;/code&gt; is cell/atom tester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How’s that work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Nock 3&lt;/code&gt;’s argument is itself a formula. Let’s call it &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[subject-a [3 formula-b]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Nock 3&lt;/code&gt; produces either a &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; or a &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, depending on what formula-b does when applied to subject-a:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[subject-a formula-b]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or more simply:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[a b]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;*[a b]&lt;/code&gt; produces a cell, then &lt;code&gt;*[a [3 b]]&lt;/code&gt; produces 0. If &lt;code&gt;*[a b]&lt;/code&gt; produces an atom, &lt;code&gt;*[a [3 b]]&lt;/code&gt; produces 1. So our pattern for Nock 3 is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[a [3 b]]         ?(*[a b])
?(cell)            0
?(atom)            1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;?(x)&lt;/code&gt; is just a litte notation so that we can write out both possible branches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should also note that Urbit uses the atom &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; to mean “yes” and the atom &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; to mean “no.” (While this may seem annoying and different, which it is, it’s the same thing that Unix does).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that context, &lt;code&gt;Nock &lt;/code&gt;3 is just asking the question “Yes or no, is Nocking these nouns together a cell?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s review what we’ve learned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;vocabulary&quot;&gt;Vocabulary:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subject is the noun that gets Nocked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The operator is an atom that tells us how to Nock the subject and arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arguments modify the behaviour of the operator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A formula is a cell of [operator arguments]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a chart:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[a [1 b]] 
*[subject [operator arguments]]
*[subject formula]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;yes_and_no&quot;&gt;Yes and No&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Atom 0 means “yes” Atom 1 means “no.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nock_3&quot;&gt;Nock 3&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nock 3 is a cell tester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[a [3 b]]         ?(*[a b])
?(cell)            0
?(atom)            1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;exercises&quot;&gt;Exercises&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run and compare&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*(a b)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*(a [3 b])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;with different values for a and b.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try finding a value for &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; that will return &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; if &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is the atom &lt;code&gt;42&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;.*(42 [3 b])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only is this possible, but you already know the formula to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</content>

   <title>Nock Tutorial&#58; Module 1 (Trees and Axes)</title>
   <link href="http://urbit.org/2014/01/18/mod1.html"/>
   <updated>2014-01-18T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://urbit.org/2014/01/18/mod1</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last module we played around with this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*(42 [0 1])
42&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which corresponds to the pattern&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[a [0 1]]                  a&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we’re going to experiment with what happens when we replace &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; with different values. Remember, as you follow along, type out the examples at your own Arvo prompt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([42 43] [0 1])
[42 43]

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([42 43] [0 2])
42

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([42 43] [0 3])
43

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([42 43] [0 4])
! exit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, this is interesting, but we don’t really have enough examples to figure out the pattern yet. Let’s change &lt;code&gt;[42 43]&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;[[44 45] 43]&lt;/code&gt; and try some more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([[44 45] 43] [0 1])
[[44 45] 43] 

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([[44 45] 43] [0 2])
[44 45]

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([[44 45] 43] [0 3])
43

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([[44 45] 43] [0 4])
44

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([[44 45] 43] [0 5])
45

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([[44 45] 43] [0 6])
! exit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like anything of the form &lt;code&gt;*[a [0 b]]&lt;/code&gt; produces sub-nouns that are inside of a. Remember that notationally, &lt;code&gt;*[a [0 b]]&lt;/code&gt; is the same as &lt;code&gt;.*(a [0 b])&lt;/code&gt; e.g. a is &lt;code&gt;[[44 45] 43]&lt;/code&gt; and b is the atoms &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; through &lt;code&gt;6&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how does &lt;code&gt;*[a [0 b]]&lt;/code&gt; know which pieces of a to choose?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s do one more example and then I’ll explain it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([42 [46 47]] [0 1])
[42 [46 47]] 

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([42 [46 47]] [0 2])
42

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([42 [46 47]] [0 3])
[46 47]

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([42 [46 47]] [0 4])
! exit

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([42 [46 47]] [0 5])
! exit

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([42 [46 47]] [0 6])
46

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([42 [46 47]] [0 7])
47&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to try to solve this puzzle on your own if you like. Just play with the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*(a [0 b])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is a cell and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is an atom. Try to pick atoms for &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; that are small and try to pick cells for &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; that have lots of nesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re ready to have things explained to you, read on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of a noun as a tree structure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;        [42 [46 47]]
        /       \
      42      [46 47]]
                / \ 
              46   47&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every cell has two branches (the head of the cell and the tail) leading down from it. Atoms have no branches, because they can’t be broken down any further (and this is exactly why they’re called atoms).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at the tree of the other noun we played with, &lt;code&gt;[[44 45] 43]&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;        [[44 45] 43]
           /      \
       [44 45]    43
        /   \
       44   45&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be pretty obvious that we could change the values of any of the atoms in the tree without changing the structure of the tree. That is to say, &lt;code&gt;[[44 45] 43]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[[24 25] 23]&lt;/code&gt; have the same tree structure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;        [[22 25] 23]
           /      \
       [22 25]    23
        /   \
       22   25&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now, for a more complicated tree, here’s the noun &lt;code&gt;[[[48 49] 45] [46 47]]&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;        [[[48 49] 45] [46 47]]
             /            \
       [[48 49] 45]      [46 47]
         /       \        /   \
      [48 49]    45      46   47
       /   \
      48   49&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do the above trees relate to running &lt;code&gt;.*(a [0 b])&lt;/code&gt;? Simple, every part of the tree gets mapped to an atomic address (we call it an axis). The mapping looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;             1 
         /       \
       2           3          
     /   \       /   \
    4     5     6     7     
   / \   / \   / \   / \
  8   9 10 11 12 13 14 15&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, because the lines are kind of ugly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;         1
    2          3
 4    5     6     7
8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this only a very small part of the enitre tree. We extend the tree by applying the rule: Every axis &lt;code&gt;/n&lt;/code&gt; has a head with the axis&lt;code&gt;/2n&lt;/code&gt; and a tail with the axis&lt;code&gt;/2n+1&lt;/code&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We map from noun to axis by comparing the tree of the noun with the axis tree and seeing what matches. Like so, marking axes with a &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; character:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    /1 : [[44 45] 43]
           /        \
   /2 : [44 45]     43 : /3
        /     \
  /4 : 44      45 : /5&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, because it bears repeating: the head of axis &lt;code&gt;/n&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;/2n&lt;/code&gt; and the tail of axis &lt;code&gt;/n&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;/2n+1&lt;/code&gt;. Remember that the head is the left-hand noun and the tail the right-hand noun of a cell-pair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start with 1. This is your root axis. All nouns have a valid axis &lt;code&gt;/1&lt;/code&gt;, even atoms. and the axis &lt;code&gt;/1&lt;/code&gt; just refers to the noun itself. In the above example, axis /1 of &lt;code&gt;[[44 45] 43]&lt;/code&gt; is just &lt;code&gt;[[44 45] 43]&lt;/code&gt;. The head of &lt;code&gt;[[44 45] 43]&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;[44 45]&lt;/code&gt; and the tail is &lt;code&gt;43&lt;/code&gt;. Thus, axis &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;2 of &lt;code&gt;[[44 45] 43]&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;[44 45]&lt;/code&gt; and axis /3 is &lt;code&gt;43&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to think about it is that the tree map has layers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;layer 0             1
layer 1        2          3
layer 2     4    5     6     7
layer 3    8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which correspond to the nesting depth of the noun. If a noun is inside two cells, like &lt;code&gt;46&lt;/code&gt; inside &lt;code&gt;[[[48 49] 45] [46 47]]&lt;/code&gt; then its axis is at layer 2 of the tree. If its inside three cells like &lt;code&gt;48&lt;/code&gt;, then its axis is at layer three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recall the pattern we learned in module 1:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[a [0 1]]                  a&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, we now see, is a special case of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[a [0 b]]              axis /b of a&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 0 in &lt;code&gt;*[a [0 b]]&lt;/code&gt; is just an operator that means axis. Nock maps simple operators and functions to atoms, instead of a character like &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; for example, because atoms (and cells) are all Nock knows. This would Fortunately for us, there are only eleven atoms that are operators, atoms &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; through &lt;code&gt;10.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;noun_structure&quot;&gt;Noun structure:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nouns are trees that look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;        [[44 45] 43]
           /      \
       [44 45]    43
        /   \
       44   45&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The left-hand of a cell is called the head. The right hand is the tail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;axes&quot;&gt;Axes:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An axis is the address of a node of the noun tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notation for axis n is /n.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of the axis tree looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;         1
    2          3
 4    5     6     7
8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The head of axis /n is /(2n) and the tail of axis /n is /(2n+1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nock_operators&quot;&gt;Nock Operators:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The operators in Nock are functions mapped onto the eleven atoms &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; through &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nock_0&quot;&gt;Nock 0:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Nock operator that produces a given axis of a noun:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[a [0 b]]               /b of a&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;exercises&quot;&gt;Exercises:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take pen and paper and map out the axes of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;      [[[48 49] 45] [46 47]]
          /             \
    [[48 49] 45]      [46 47]
      /       \        /   \
   [48 49]    45      46   47
    /   \
   48   49&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then to test yourself, run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*([[[48 49] 45] [46 47]] [0 b])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for each axis &lt;code&gt;/b&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;[[[48 49] 45] [46 47]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write a noun &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; such that the following produces something:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*(a [0 100])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, find a noun that has an axis &lt;code&gt;/100&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prune your noun from the last exercis so that its as short as possible, while still having an axis &lt;code&gt;/100&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you still feel confused, replicate the previous two exercises with the axes &lt;code&gt;/7&lt;/code&gt;, ‘/17’, ‘/27’, ‘/47’ and &lt;code&gt;/87&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build a noun that has every atom set to its own axis. The bigger the noun the better. I’ll get you started:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 [2 3] [[4 5] 3] [[4 5] [6 7]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To test different atoms in your noun, run&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*(a [0 b])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Nock Tutorial&#58; Module 0 (Start Here)</title>
   <link href="http://urbit.org/2014/01/18/mod0.html"/>
   <updated>2014-01-18T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://urbit.org/2014/01/18/mod0</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Okay, so you want to learn Nock. You’ve read through the reference doc and you’re worried that you’re not smart enough for this strange alien software. This Urbit thing is cool, but it’s not as if you can quit your day job to spend your days poring over cryptic Martian squiggles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fear not. Urbit, for better or worse, is stupider than you are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These modules are not designed to replace the existing reference documentation. Their purpose is not to teach you what Urbit is, but rather what you can do with it. As much practice and as little theory as we can manage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll assume that you’ve gone through the Urbit setup process and have an Arvo prompt that looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing we’re going to do is learn how to evaluate Nock code inside of Arvo. At your prompt, type the following exactly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*(42 [0 1])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should return &lt;code&gt;42&lt;/code&gt;. Don’t worry about what this is doing yet. (A reader who has seen Nock before may wonder where the paretheses came from. Patience, all will be revealed.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s very important that you actually go to your prompt and type in our examples. Copying and pasting is cheating. This might seem silly, but to learn Nock (or any language, really) it’s very important that your fingers get comfortable writing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you accidentally make a mistake typing in a Nock expression, you’ll get a syntax error:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*(42[0 1]) 
~ &amp;lt;syntax error at [1 6]&amp;gt;

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*( 42 [0 1]) 
~ &amp;lt;syntax error at [1 4]&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easiest way to get a sytax error is to accidentally leave out a space. Or add an extra one. Fortunately, the error message tells you where the mistake is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~ &amp;lt;syntax error at [1 4]&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;means that there’s an error at &lt;code&gt;line 1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;column 4&lt;/code&gt;. And once you know where an error is, its easy to fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even if your Nock expression is formatted correctly, you might get something that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*(42 [5 0 1]) 
! exit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that the expression you typed in is correct Nock, but it just doesn’t produce anything. Unfortunately, we can’t give you line and column numbers on this one, so the only surefire way to debug an exit message is to understand what your code is doing. Literally speaking, an exit message means you tried to do something that just doesn’t make sense. Like trying to reference data that doesn’t exist, or trying to increment something that’s not a number, or asking if &lt;code&gt;42&lt;/code&gt; is equal, without asking what it’s equal to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now enough about errors, let’s practice some real expressions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*(41 [0 1]) 
41

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*(40 [0 1]) 
40

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*(374 [0 1]) 
374&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The perceptive reader will notice the pattern here: If a is a number, &lt;code&gt;.*(a [0
1])&lt;/code&gt; always produces &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;. Don’t believe me? Test it. Run the following, but replace a with whatever you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*(a [0 1]) 
a&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’re satisfied that this is true, let’s do something slightly different:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*(374 [1 0]) 
0

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*(40 [1 0]) 
0

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*(41 [1 0]) /
0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This pattern is pretty easy: &lt;code&gt;*(a [1 0])&lt;/code&gt; always produces &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, no matter what a is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, play around with the above yourself by choosing your own values for a:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*(a [1 0]) 
0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more pattern, and then we’ll actually explain what the heck is going on here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*(374 [1 374]) 
374

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*(40 [1 374]) 
374

~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*(374 [1 40]) 
40&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an exercise, run the last three lines again but replace &lt;code&gt;374&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;40&lt;/code&gt; with number of your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably already guessed the pattern here: &lt;code&gt;.*(a [1 b])&lt;/code&gt; always produces &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, regardless of &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;. But feel free to test it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*(a [1 b]) 
b&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; are, of course, just variables that are standing in for numbers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s run the first piece of example code again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*(42 [0 1])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nock is made up of two basic building blocks: atoms, which can be any non-negative whole number, and cells, which are pairs of numbers or cells (cells can go inside of other cells.) &lt;code&gt;42&lt;/code&gt;, for example, is an atom. &lt;code&gt;[0 1]&lt;/code&gt; is a cell. Even &lt;code&gt;[42 [0
1]]&lt;/code&gt; is a cell. (It’s very important to notice that cells can nest inside other cells.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collectively, both atoms and cells are called nouns. And Nock is just a list of rules (or a set of patterns) for transforming nouns. You put one noun in, you get another noun out. It’s like algebra, &lt;code&gt;f(x) = y&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;nock(noun_a) = noun_b&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The atom &lt;code&gt;42&lt;/code&gt; is a noun, the cell &lt;code&gt;[0 1]&lt;/code&gt; is a noun, Actually, &lt;code&gt;.*(42 [0 1])&lt;/code&gt; is a noun too, except that its wrapped in an expression that means “run this noun through Nock”. &lt;code&gt;.*(42 [0 1])&lt;/code&gt; is actually the way to tell Arvo (Urbit’s operating system) to evaluate &lt;code&gt;Nock([42 [0 1]])&lt;/code&gt;. The cellular noun &lt;code&gt;[42 [0
1]]&lt;/code&gt; goes into Nock, the atomic noun &lt;code&gt;42&lt;/code&gt; comes out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could simply write our very first example again as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;nock([42 [0 1]]) = 42&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;except that we wouldn’t be able to evaluate it in Arvo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, we never really use the above mathematical notation. For the sake of brevity we almost alway write nock(a) as &lt;code&gt;*a&lt;/code&gt;. So &lt;code&gt;.*(42 [0 1])&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;*[42 [0
1]]&lt;/code&gt; mean the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;*[42 [0 1]]&lt;/code&gt; notation is useful, because it helps us write down the patterns wenoticed more concisely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of, for example, writing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt; .*(a [1 b]) 
b&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the standard way of writing out patterns is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[a [1 b]]                  b&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;with the left hand side being the matching noun and the right side being the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude this module, let’s review what we’ve learned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Math notation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;nock([42 [0 1]]) = 42&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we have a draft of chapter 8 up, checking it
for markdown errors
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the doc is speeding up, ladies and gentlemen
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: excitément
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: okay, chapter 8 is up
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this one gets us through, basically, how we do
function calls in hoon
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: it&amp;#39;s named chapter 7

~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: this is so great
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: it never occurred to me that cores would be nested like
that
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: I thought a library was just a stack of independent
cores, each of which&amp;#39;s context is the whole battery

~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: it is pretty hard to get things in and around html

~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: (except in the cases you want it to ignore
whitespace)
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: hang on i&amp;#39;ll go fix it
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: looks like it&amp;#39;s just not grabbing the extra

don&amp;#39;t work very hard at it
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: the arrow keys don&amp;#39;t seem to work very well around
line breaks
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: welcome ~dolrux-nomlup
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: you should check out the banner system
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: switch to your banner with | switch back with &amp;amp;
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: get help with ?
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: the line breaks are still slightly buggy
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: long lines delete past lines
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and don&amp;#39;t press ctrl w
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: it causes problems
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: but other than that
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: this place is pretty solid
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: 
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: so does preceding a line with the prompt send that
line into the specified place?
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: I keep thinking about the multiline input
thing
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: (yes it does ~dolrux although the prompt
character alone will send a blank line)
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: it&amp;#39;s just slightly out of reach of most
stupid fixes I come up with
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: but it is definitely not a hard fix
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: rather, I have like 80% confidence that
it&amp;#39;s not a hard fix
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: multiline input?
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: hard to weight priorities for fixes of
subsystems that are getting ripped out soon
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: er uh rather when your input line is
longer than your terminal is wide
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: and it starts eating history lines
because our term code is lame
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: oh. duh. there&amp;#39;s actually a really
obvious fix.
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: just chop off the start of the input line
when we redraw.
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: i think that&amp;#39;s what irssi does
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: son of a

~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: yeah, lemme do that real quick...

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is now and forever hep.
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: yo, daddy-o.  you got that zoot suit ready?
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot; &amp;#39;s father claimed to have once owned a zoot suit.
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: But he could not produce it for inspection so we withheld
judgement.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] isn&amp;#39;t that old but he read about zoot suits in
&amp;quot;The Autobiography of Malcolm X.&amp;quot;
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: well,
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;  isn&amp;#39;t that old EITHER, but his dad was old-ish when he
was born. (late 40&amp;#39;s in 1964 when I first breathed the air of planet erde)
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: so, maybe I am that old. :-(
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] &amp;#39;s internets keep going up and down, this is
apparently the problem with renting office space
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] feels ancient, generally.
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] is in the building
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: Think of it only as a form of continuous stress testing.
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: The office internets, I mean.
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: Hey, do you have a dog?  Do you need a dog walking
service? :-)
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;  has a good friend who runs a dog walking service in SF.
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;  promises to shut up and stop plugging Arty&amp;#39;s Adventures. 
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] does not have a dog.  does your friend walk
children?
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] considers starting a child walking service if
his startup fails.
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: Hm.  I believe dogs and children are relatively
equivalent.  Certainly our dogs are easier to walk than our children.
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: I don&amp;#39;t think she&amp;#39;s huge into children, though.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] never heard of a dog that refused to put its
pants on in the morning.
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: EXACTLY.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: 
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: Or, agreed to put its pants on and yet inexplicably
failed to take any directed action in this regard.
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: Dogs and children do have similar feelinga about hygiene,
though.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: hmm. I should put some pants on.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: (Home offices are not good for discipline,
it seems.)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is both in the office and wearing pants.
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: if we wanted discipline, we&amp;#39;d all be writing C++.
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;  has to return to writing C++ after lunch.. :-(
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: No language with a preprocessor can be
said to possess discipline, I think
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: &amp;quot;#define private public // lol&amp;quot;
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: OK.  Maybe it&amp;#39;s just bondage then.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: it&amp;#39;s.... something, definitely
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: OBTW, if I have things I think might be corrections to
the doc, or possibly bug reports, depending on factors beyond my ken, should I
submit a pull reque st on the doc tree and let youse guys sort it out?
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;  swears that if a time machine ever becomes available, he
will use it to do what is required to divert Stroustrup.
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: Anyway, back to the Real World, non-MTV variant...  lunch
is over.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: At least some people are taking seriously
the idea of building something better that covers C++&amp;#39;s use cases.
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot; has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you should absolutely submit pull requests to
the doc
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: speaking of C++, I&amp;#39;m a big fan of Rust
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this project actually started out with the goal
of building something like Rust
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: yeah. it&amp;#39;s pretty funny, graydon was the
guy who introduced me to haskell
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: rust seems to be a counterexample to the
thesis that a language or platform has to be bad to be popular
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: (On the other hand, there&amp;#39;s Go, which
suggests that it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be bad to be popular, but it helps.)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: well, rust is not popular yet, but I think it&amp;#39;s
built for the long run
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I want eventually all our jets to be in rust
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] distrusts go due to the GC
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: All the cool kids are excited about Rust,
which is a favorable sign for future popularity.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: also, you really can&amp;#39;t do a typed language
without genericity
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes it is.  also, Mozilla somehow ended up as
the only place that both makes money and creates actual new technology.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: well, Mozilla and Google.  If you don&amp;#39;t count
Mozilla as a tentacle of Google.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Yeah. I don&amp;#39;t entirely understand it.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ou sont les SGIs d&amp;#39;antan?
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Mozilla is as independent from Google as
Canada is from the US. Which is to say, they&amp;#39;re different places.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: I am not dismayed by any particular
failing of Go, more so by the enthusiasm with which such a thoroughly mediocre
tool was received.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: It&amp;#39;s pretty much a rehash of the last
language Rob Pike built so far as I can tell.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: It&amp;#39;s amazed me how much weight several
people I&amp;#39;ve talked to have placed on the production of single-file executables.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: (Which seems to be a major appeal to Go
enthusiasts.)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that&amp;#39;s pretty funny about the US and Canada
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I haven&amp;#39;t looked at Go all that closely
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I also prefer event systems to thread blocking
systems, mostly because state between events is much better characterized
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] doesn&amp;#39;t like meaningful state to live in stacks
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: well yes, blocking IO is immoral.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: (Purely in a technical sense. ;)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: well, when you are not doing blocking IO, you
have to think about congestion in slightly different ways
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: this is true.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has made several early programming mistakes in
Hoon apps where he built up enormous buffers of unsendable messages
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a blocking system would have prevented this
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Are you familiar with the Hayekian
argument for event-driven systems?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but on the other hand, the ends do need to know
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the... the what?
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]:
http://www.erights.org/elib/concurrency/event-loop.html#safety
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] doesn&amp;#39;t really see Hayek as a programmer
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes.  well, it might be a metaphor too far
afield, but basically it&amp;#39;s right I think
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the CSP metaphor is just too attractive in some
ways and becomes very indisciplined
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: at the same time, threading is a way to get
parallelism, which is rather more difficult in an event system
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] hopes that an urbit which is stable will provide
many ways for a smart implementation to &amp;quot;cheat&amp;quot; and execute in parallel
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Sure. My usual argument on that is that
threading is only a useful application-level concept for a small set of use
cases
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: where you have cpu-bound tasks that can be
parallelized, but don&amp;#39;t want to spread them over multiple hosts
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes.  also, the better your system is at FP,
the easier it is to make things that look like threads within the event model.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: games and web browsers are the typical
examples... and Rust tasks seem to cover that pretty well
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: sure.  but this is generally small-scale
parallelism by definition
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: right.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: much of it is covered by something like a
parallelizable loop
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s pretty easy to automagically parallelize
various kinds of list comprehensions
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: For large scale parallelism, an event loop
model works OK because you can run one event loop per process
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: because hey, you couldn&amp;#39;t share that data
any faster than by message passing anyway, right
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but there are certainly cases where you&amp;#39;d like
to take the Arvo event loop and squeeze out some parallelism
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Right. and some of the recent work on STM
helps there
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: right as well.  ultimately this will happen
when Arvo is extremely stable and none of it is in practice interpreted
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: if you have deterministic steps in your
execution model, you can run a bunch of them simultaneously and roll back the
ones that conflict
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that&amp;#39;s exactly right, especially with an
immutable data model
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: well that does make the implementation
simpler, to be sure. :)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: actually apart from the vanes (kernel modules),
the arvo event loop at the end of hoon.hoon is only about 300 lines
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: relatively simple dispatch semantics, although
it&amp;#39;s a little more complicated than you might expect
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the basic principle is that an event comes with
a stack of paths (a duct), so it is very easy to build a service-response
pattern
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]  nods
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and this little kernel thingy has been quite
stable
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: in fact we seem to be more or less at infinite
uptime with zod and doznec
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we are probably going to do another continuity
breach at some point, but if we had to not do it we could
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it would be hard to imagine creating &amp;quot;state
that lasts for ever&amp;quot; if part of that state was encoded as blocked threads
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: when you don&amp;#39;t let the programmer block, you
force her to actually decide what her state is
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: this is true
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: then, she can write a function to update it and
so on when she upgrades her app
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: actually to implement what appears to be
blocking on network resources
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: to the programmer this looks like blocking on
the global namespace
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but it&amp;#39;s not blocking
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: state and upgrade are issues rather poorly
addressed by most systems
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: actually what happens is that we just throw
away the computation and requeue the event (not at the arvo level, at the batz
level)
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: right. this is pretty much the same
conclusion E reached
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is trying to build a personal cloud computer, so
it should just upgrade itself without even thinking about it
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] thinks E&amp;#39;s major problem was always its biggest
feature, the capabilities
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: if you solve identity you don&amp;#39;t need
capabilities
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the question I as a server should be asking is
not: what rights does this peer have?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the right question is: who is this peer?  and
then, what rights have I granted to that identity?
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: &amp;quot;need&amp;quot; is always a slippery concept when
discussing fundamental abstractions. if you have nock you don&amp;#39;t need hoon. :)
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: That&amp;#39;s a good question but it ignores
agency. Sometimes I want others to do things on my behalf.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: of course one doesn&amp;#39;t need anything, it&amp;#39;s an
aesthetic question of right and wrong
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: perhaps there are corner cases of complex
delegation, but it is a mistake I feel to build them in at the bottom layer
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: complex cases should be handled in complex ways
at a higher level
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is certainly possible to think about
capabilities on top of an identity layer
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but they exist in unusual, not usual, cases
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you are not putting as much weight on the
feature.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: hmm. I seem to recall something being said
about things having to start from a simple model if they&amp;#39;re ever going to
work... :)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: :)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the thing is, identity is a simple problem if
you just grab the bull by the horns
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: abstracting identity is not a simple problem
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Anyway. The higher-level implications of
capabilities are more debatable and less immediately interesting to me than the
practical implica tions of having a secure, principled object model

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] prefers namespaces to objects
~rovrel-bicmyl has left the building
~rovrel-bicmyl is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: if you force human-readable paths at all
levels...
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: I guess this comes down to trees vs graphs
then. :)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it does.  and I don&amp;#39;t like to build graphs of
opaque pointers even on a single system
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has to go water the horses.

~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; scrolls forward.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] likes to have interesting technical discussions
on :chat
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: The vere pauses appear to be: fsync takes 0.2 seconds
approximately, and then another 0.2 seconds of mprotect/SIGSEGV, and then
read(0) reads 10 bytes.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; hasn&amp;#39;t sat down with a stopwatch to judge how long it
pauses, just notes that it&amp;#39;s noticeable.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: When it is performing well, read(0) always gets 1 byte
at a time.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that is really really slowness
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] attributes it to your unusual configurationz
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; is willing to accept that as a diagnosis.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s still not optimal
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: basically, vere is a prototype 
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it actually works pretty well for a prototype
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: That it does.
~fosryg-sonbet &amp;quot;kulibali&amp;quot; is in the building
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: you are saying &amp;quot;prototype&amp;quot; as if &amp;quot;prototype&amp;quot; is even a
thing
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: it&amp;#39;s not because a voluntary rewrite is usually a
disaster
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: (and involuntary ones result from disasters)
~fosryg-sonbet &amp;quot;kulibali&amp;quot; has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: well, there&amp;#39;s rewriting and rewriting
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: my feeling is that the time to rewrite is when
you don&amp;#39;t have to
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: in a tall system software stack, preserving the
lack of a need to rewrite is crucial
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: vere itself is a relatively thin layer, and
relatively clean in some ways
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but it should not be too hard to replace its
noun/nock layer with a 64-bit one that has an LLVM JIT
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and this is in fact what we&amp;#39;re doing (or it&amp;#39;s
what Chris Cole is doing)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Steve is also making the event log Raft-powered
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but in general, it should end up as a very
clean, durable, stable system
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so that we can spend our energy on userspace...

~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: my roommate&amp;#39;s friend mentioned that the

almost certain tha t we&amp;#39;ve mentioned that already but thought I&amp;#39;d repeat it.

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] missed the backlog when he returned,
interestingly
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: :chat definitely remains a prototype
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s correlated with a went-fear message that
indicates a message was received, but the process waiting for it was dead
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: :room needs to receive a negative ack for this
and consider the message as failed

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] thinks the words for &amp;quot;library&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;object&amp;quot; are

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: in general you don&amp;#39;t want a cyst (a core
containing dynamic data) - but it&amp;#39;s better than a tumor...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: no, that&amp;#39;s too grisly.  we&amp;#39;ll make it &amp;quot;book&amp;quot;
and &amp;quot;cart.&amp;quot;

~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: when i started up vere
earlier, it had trouble getting anything from ~doznec
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: sends but won&amp;#39;t receive?
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: so eventually i quit vere
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: restarted it, and it
connected fine
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: but then when i did :chat, it
didn&amp;#39;t go through any backlog
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: also i saw some messages
starting with %went-fear
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: yes, i believe tasfyn-partyv was just
noticing this deficiency in chat&amp;#39;s implementation
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i wouldn&amp;#39;t have seen 
~tasfyn-partyv&amp;#39;s req for info if i didn&amp;#39;t have ~nolnym-bolnes running in ec2
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: &amp;amp; ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: labfes-larzod, are

~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;:  you state that the state of the state is your

~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: right, for a state-speech
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: by a statesman
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: the mental state that leads to stating that the
state of the state etc
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: c state state state, yes
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: the state&amp;#39;s-state-stating state
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] is adding a bunch of c state
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot; checks in to see what state the state is in

bunch of things including theden, which looks interesting
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: was that too creepy?
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: there&amp;#39;s this scene in &amp;#39;her&amp;#39; where
j. phoenix admits to digitally stalking the girl he&amp;#39;s on a first date with, and
she says &amp;#39;awe, th at&amp;#39;s so sweet of you&amp;#39;

:)
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: i&amp;#39;m going to arrive home and find

~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;me! me!&amp;quot; little slapfights
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: i don&amp;#39;t even want to imagine what
banners would do to eachother
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: whack each other with their... banners
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: It depends on the banner. I doubt %zen would be
particularly aggressive.
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: spoken like a man who has not spent
significant time at a %zen monastery
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: do we actually have a %zen banner
now?
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: you see some pretty heated arguments in

~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: whose no-self is bigger, that sort of
thing
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: no we don&amp;#39;t that I know of
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: can i make required reading for the

~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: I concede to personal experience, SSDD.

~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: hello
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Ave, ~tognex-labmeb.
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: i was overeager with my edits
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: hi tognex
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: hello?
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: this thing is on
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: hello tiktalik
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: we can read ypu
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: oh good, it&amp;#39;s working
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: you are likely scrolling through the backlog
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: my laptop is a bit slow, that&amp;#39;s all
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: and you.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: nah, I&amp;#39;m used to backlog from IRC and such, figured
it was backlog. takes a bit before my text even gets properly entered...
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: is there a way to move what computer your urbit
stuff is on?
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: move the pier, it is portable
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: And ~/.urbit
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: pier, urb/$ships and ~/.urbit
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: but don&amp;#39;t run the same pier from more than one
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: oh, yes, the passcode
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: alright, that&amp;#39;s good to know
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Duplicating ships on the network would be like crossing
the streams, so it&amp;#39;s rumored.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: the urbit tutorials read like some alien...thing,
like all the words are the same, but mean something else entirely. felt like
learning how to use c omputers for the first time, heh. so I decided &amp;quot;hey, why
not try this thing out?&amp;quot;

~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: after all, the worst that can happen is I have to
reinstall xubuntu
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Have you ever read Stephenson&amp;#39;s Anathem, ~tognex?
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: nope
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot; has left the building
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: If you like the &amp;quot;urbit sensation&amp;quot; of familiar words
signifying strange things, Anathem inspires the dual emotion of strange words
mapped to familiar things.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: so does this chat let you chat with all urbit chat
users currently using urbit chat?
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Correct.
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: some are paying more attention than
others
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: bet that&amp;#39;ll get cramped if urbit takes off.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: am I accidentally sending things
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: don&amp;#39;t think so?&amp;gt;
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: hopefully by the time it
would get cramped
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: ok, good. just checking, what do these &amp;quot;...&amp;quot;s mean?
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: there&amp;#39;ll be a better chat
system
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: hah! hopefully something similar to IRC.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: multiple channels and all that
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: ... means your ship is waiting for a response from~doznec, the :room server.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: I did expect vere to print &amp;quot;I am a
prototype for a much larger system.&amp;quot; when I started it.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: ah, okay.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: so does urbit have any practical uses yet?
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: friendship
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: conversation
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: ideas
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot; shrugs
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: works for me.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Conspiracy (behind banners).
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: heh, how do banners work?
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: There are three prefixes
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;|&amp;quot;
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;&amp;amp;&amp;quot;
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: and ~$shipname
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: which switch the recipient of the messages which follow
them
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;|&amp;quot; is for members of your political banner.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: but the switch to and from
banner at one point worked differently from the swtich to and from direct
message
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: it may still
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: %blue, in your case, ~tognex.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Isn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;confusing people&amp;quot; enough of a
purpose? :)
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: heh
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Confusion and enlightenment dance in such close order.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: 
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: yeah, I chose blue because, well, it seemed a
reasonably safe choice, while not being as boring as white
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: i think i figured out why programmers like
Zen stories/koans so much.
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: am i the only %white?
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: i take great pride in being boring
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: quite possibly
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: so how do you use the prefixes?
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: It&amp;#39;s because they&amp;#39;re usually about a
smarter person saying stuff to confuse dumber people, and then hitting them.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: E.g. |Greetings, banner-mate.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: 
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Only %blue comrades would see this, and your prompt
would change from &amp;amp; to |.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: alright, so just start a message with the prefix,
and future messages will be sent to that one?
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: 
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Correct, until you send a message with a different
prefix.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: ok!
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i am still confused by
prefixes
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: There is no null message, so &amp;amp; or | alone sends a blank.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: How so, ~labfes?
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: (Also, type ? for the help page.)
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: now i am less confused
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: am i the only one?
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: maybe the only one on right this minute.
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: 
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: ah, so you don&amp;#39;t just prefix the
message
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: talsur, I have :thumbed nearly every ship to sail these
waters, and have seen a multiplicity of every banner.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: i suppose i&amp;#39;m all alone in blueland?
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: currently, anyway
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: *whew
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: \?
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: was there a precursor to :thumb?
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: whew?
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: i remember using something else
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: :report
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: talsur what do you mean by
&amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t just prefix the message&amp;quot;
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: tognex kind of sounds like the name of some alien
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Which still works, but give the entire routing path.
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: like, send a | to switch modes
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: don&amp;#39;t just prefix a message with |
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Ah, but not too alien, for it still sounds like a name.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: better than fantyv.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: talsur, but you do send a message - a blank message.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Or rather, empty but not null.
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: so there&amp;#39;s always an empty message
for a switch
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Is this the real life, or is this just fan-ty-v?
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: but not after that
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: so, how many people typically come on?
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: because this is rather interesting.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: talsur, yes, but the initial switch can also send a
message.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: fantyv, you mean will
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: I will now send: ~talsur-todres Ave.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: right?
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: right, like |bye, off to banner
land
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: so fantyv, why aren&amp;#39;t we calling you jpt4? :P
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot; has left the building
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;:  ~talsur-todres Ave.
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: ~fantyv-ralpen
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Because I am ~fantyv-ralpen.
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: right, but the first message is
sent publicly?
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: so we all go by ship names, not our... usernamey
things?
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: No, I accidentally added an ace at the beginning.
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: i think i did too, so no switch
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: I am not sure a strong convention has
emerged. :)
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: ~fantyv-ralpen
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: We are still both public, ~talsur-san.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: dondep, ?
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: confused, for the moment
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I tend to check in and out at any
and all times of day
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: do we have to say :hi first?
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: ~
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: yes
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: so what kind of things do you lot talk about
~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc] is in the building
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: What do you like to talk about, Tiktalik?
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: ello, nosryl
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: eh, lots of things
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: depends on what things i feel like talking about.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Ichthyology, perhaps?
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: heh, this username was mostly chosen on a whim, and
it&amp;#39;s hard for the people who are bad at using google to find out about stuff
i&amp;#39;ve done
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: sure, it can be thwarted with a bit of skill, but
most people have no clue how
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: you could also just tell us
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: well, every once in a while I /attempt/ to program,
with varying levels of success
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: i play various online games like minecraft, or tf2,
or etc
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: kind of a boring person.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: I am prepared to declare at least 3/4 of the Urbit
population &amp;quot;Axios&amp;quot;, if you are worried.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: Axios?
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: sounds ominous, even if I have no clue what it means
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Worthy&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;He is worthy&amp;quot; in Greek.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: What we call meritocracy ought properly be named
axiocracy.
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: well, at this stage, if you&amp;#39;re even
here
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: ah
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: that&amp;#39;s a pretty good sign
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: merit is just using the command
line
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: so what can I do with my battleship, besides chat?
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: destroyer!
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Your destroyer is your own personal Hoon machine.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: oh right, destroyer
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: you can do anything you want with
it
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: .0
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: what
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: man a game of battleship
would be cool
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Work through the doc (along with everyone else) and join
the world of personal, general purpose, functional computing.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: so what are the various arvo files destroyers/subs
grab?
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Applications.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Like synchronizing with a package manager that only has
one repository.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: i see. so basically, what applications you get is up
to the whims of the network?
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: No, it is up to the whim of ~zod.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: For your submarine.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: And ~doznec, for your destroyer.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: I see.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: So destroyers, do they get more stuff than
submarines?
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: so whichever ship our ship
comes from determines our software
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: oh, ok
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i was asking
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: labfes, yes, although that&amp;#39;s not as important as
receivng namespace.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: what is recving namespace
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Your destroyer is one of 2^32.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: 2^16 of which were begotten of ~doznec.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: begotten ... not made
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Tiktalik: I am one of the few
non-coders in the Urbitverse at present
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: badump
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: what happens if they run out of destroyers?
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Of one being with ~zod, father of ~doznec.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: We run out.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: well difryt, glad to see there are others here who
don&amp;#39;t code.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: though I&amp;#39;ve been working on it.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Each destroyer can spawn 2^32 yachts.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: imrowan, i am sure cgy would just say that
means you have less to unlearn before using hoon
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: ;-)
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Precisely why I&amp;#39;m hoping for one
of those Hoon Like I&amp;#39;m 5 *g*
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: (I believe that is the number.)
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: But each yacht is dependent on its destroyer.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: OT does anyone know if beer
is good at dealing with hot spicy taste
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Only destroyers and above have independent, alloidial,
reputation.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: definitely not, needs something
emulsifying like milk
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: labfes, lipids are what you want.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: so... anything below destroyers is temporary?
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Not temporary, dependent.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: submarines?
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: If anything, submarines are temporary, since there are
so many of them.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: submarines are, I think, independent.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Yes, they are independent, even of ~zod, I believe.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: well, what happens when all the destroyers are gone?
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i am lactose intolerant so i
guess i will just tough it out
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: tognex people will sell them
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Destroyers won&amp;#39;t be gone, just owned
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: they are like real estate
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: labfes, drink olive oil.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: and you can get one from someone who has
one
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: and yeah labfes, olive oil works
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: right now, the destroyer
market is like this video: http://youtu.be/cd4-UnU8lWY
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] will shortly be making the switch to ~hobmed-hinrym
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: It&amp;#39;s like the Metaverse in Snow Crash
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: so destroyers are free and plentiful, but later on
there&amp;#39;ll be less of them avaliable, and they&amp;#39;ll start being something that
needs paid for?
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: proximity, ergo space, matters to humans.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: So Urbit simulates space via address scarcity.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: yes. this is because right now destroyers
are worthless, being only useful for super nerds who want to use a chat system
worse than IRC
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: that video is so perfect
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: heh. what about yachts?
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] has left the building
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: how do they work
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: yachts essentially belong to their
destroyer, as I understand it.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: You issue them with the :ticket command.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Which produces a ticket for the yacht name (address)
given.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: what do higher-tier ships provide, anyway?
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Routing.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: And default software.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: What does a particular distribution of GNU/Linux
provide?
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] is in the building
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: I really want to hear more about what
access patterns this identity system is going to provide.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Support, and some mix of utilities beyond the kernel
itself.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: if ships are like land, what&amp;#39;s the
equivalent of a lease?
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: scratch that. turns out I activated
hobmed on another computer this era...
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Lease, ~dondep? 
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Would you not prefer to own instead of rent?
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: kind of a silly question
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: people prefer to own and rent in different
situations re land
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: sometimes you want one, or the other
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: do any of you think urbit has a serious chance of
taking off, out of curiosity?
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: I can lease your cyber-space by executing code on your
machine.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: I own a few computers. It&amp;#39;s convenient to
lease one from Amazon for a few hours.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: i have doubts, but if it does, it&amp;#39;s worth the effort
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: That&amp;#39;s what the access control metals provide.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Currently we are all %gold.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Its like templeOS or the Commodore64, all ring 0.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: But unless virgin, land is always owned.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: *virgin and feral
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: I don&amp;#39;t mean that to be rude, I&amp;#39;m just curious as to
if you people think it&amp;#39;ll honestly take off
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: I would prefer that it did.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: I think it will not die for as long as I am alive.
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Failing world domination or even
mainstream recognition, I&amp;#39;d be satisfied with Urbit providing a useful
alternative to the existi ng Internet.

~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: And it will expand for as long as Czyarvin is alive.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: I think it&amp;#39;s too soon to tell
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: but if Urbit doesn&amp;#39;t survive, it&amp;#39;ll be
because something based on similar principles superseded it
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: What /is/ urbit, anyway
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: I&amp;#39;ve been trying to figure that out
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: os? internet alternative?
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Its a very tightly integrated system
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: the whole software stack here
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: ok, so all of the above?
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: yes, it&amp;#39;s a distributed OS
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: i think that&amp;#39;s apt dondep — that if
it doesn&amp;#39;t survive it&amp;#39;s because something similar overtakes it
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: which means it provides both a basis for
computation and a communications system designed to work with it
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: The Web is also a distributed OS
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: so are there any urbit...sites?
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: there&amp;#39;s a web server
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: somewhere
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: it&amp;#39;s just one that accreted more-or-less
by accident rather than a thing designed to be one.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: (*It&amp;#39;s, incidentally. Curse my apostrophe neglect.)
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: (This record is public and eternal darn it, edit what
you type ~fantyv.)
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: apostrophic
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Just for PR&amp;#39;s sake, once you have
a &amp;quot;What Is Urbit&amp;quot; for public consumption, it&amp;#39;d be worth adding to the Archive
Team&amp;#39;s page at ht tp://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/Hoon

~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: so where are the conspiracies
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: I think our gracious host is probably
wrong about how far the concept of identity takes you, so I&amp;#39;m not putting all
my technical eggs in t he Urbit basket -- the capability model of authority
management has major benefits, from my perspective, over traditional ACLs

~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: You&amp;#39;re in one right now, ~tognex.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: any deeper layers?
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: probably hidden under the non-blue banners
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Behind banners, mostly.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: i mean, do blues even have anything to conspire over
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Start your own. Conspiracies are cool, and very
underrated.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: 
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Speaking of distributed OSes, here&amp;#39;s an
essay I really enjoyed:
http://dreamsongs.com/Files/DesignBeyondHumanAbilitiesSimp.pdf
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: i&amp;#39;m not even sure if i&amp;#39;ve picked the banner i want,
heh
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: is there a way to change it, if you have a political
change of heart?
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Not until the re-keying protocol is finished.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: ok.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: You essentially will have to re-:begin your ship
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: also, this chat is publically logged? D:
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: which will also happen after the next continuity breach.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Yes, ~doznec stores everything it sees, your ship stores
everything it sees, mine does...
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: ah, so either way, we&amp;#39;ll be beginning again
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: now that&amp;#39;s just spooky
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: i expected less surveilance and data collection
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: not more of it
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: how much HD space does that eat, anyway
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Run du -h on your pier to find out.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: That&amp;#39;s where the event log and checkpoint are stored.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Also, this is more like sousveillance than surveillance
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: sousvevillance?
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: everyone knows everyone, by default, records all
interactions in which they take part.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: oh, like what I do in every irc channel I&amp;#39;m in. :P
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: ah. is there a way to have private interactions?
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: yes, you start a message with ~shipname
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: ~tognex-labmeb
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: The :hi ~$shipname &amp;quot;message&amp;quot; approach also works, from
the command line.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: ah.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Those kinds of communication are encrypted by default.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: and will that be tracked by both of them?
~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: 
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: no one
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: except both end points
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: well, that&amp;#39;s good to know... probably safer than
IRC, actually
~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]  just read the help.  It&amp;#39;s quite helpful.
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: you get the help by typing ?
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: yeah, found it
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: so is there a way to remove history and such from
your ship?
~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: 
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: As I understand, yes in theory, but it would be a
particularly Orwellian operation.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: The false history would have to be crafted so as to keep
present state identical.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: what happens if stuff just gets from the ship
folder? things go boom?
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: And any computation that relied on the past, now
disappeared, events would fail.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Do you mean urb/$shipname?
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: yes
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: It depends on what you remove.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: I just don&amp;#39;t feel entirely secure with a conspiracy
that can be thwarted via the lead pipe manuver, you know?
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: can stuff actually be deleted
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: http://xkcd.com/538/
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: can ship space ever be freed
up
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: In the arvo filesystem, yes.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: these sound like good questions to raise
in... 50 minutes
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: The event log records inputs, not outputs.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: If you&amp;#39;ve ever had the &amp;quot;replaying events&amp;quot; message when
starting your pier
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: your ship was re-computing the results of its past
history
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: to bring you to its present state.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: oh. so it was doing everything it did in the past,
all over again?
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: is there a system that&amp;#39;s resistant
to lead pipe cryptanalysis?
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: From the last checkpoint, yes.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: If I encrypt something with 99999999999999999999 bit RSA
and die, then yes.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: talsur, store the password in muscle memory and get
them to break all your fingers
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: the dying part is &amp;quot;key&amp;quot;
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: But deletion is isomorphic to rendering unreadable.
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: sorry, meant &amp;#39;practical&amp;#39; system
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: woah, hey. let&amp;#39;s not die
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Dying is very practical.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: not really
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: you have to stop EVERYTHING you&amp;#39;re doing
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: just so that you can stop existing?
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: It simply demands a very stringent cost-benefit
analysis.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: &amp;gt;:|
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: deleting files from urb/$ship does nothing
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: other than change the latest version of that
file
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: past versions are unaffected
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: k
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Are they copied entirely, or is only a delta stored with
each change?
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: So that the latest version is in fact the sum of the
initial version and all recorded changes?
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: btw if you do a git pull &amp;amp;&amp;amp; make clean
all, you&amp;#39;ll get a vere that doesn&amp;#39;t destroy terminal history on long lines
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: the way it doesn&amp;#39;t destroy terminal
history is a little cheesy, unfortunately
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: namely we just chomp off a prefix of your
line, which in chat can be a little disorienting, I&amp;#39;m just now discovering
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: a more real fix is coming real soon now
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: in the meantime, hopefully you&amp;#39;re less
confused about missing the first parts of your own messages than you were about
missing entire chu nks of other people&amp;#39;s messages

~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: ~fantyv-ralpen
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Does it require restarting vere to take effect?
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: yeah, it&amp;#39;s a C level hack
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Thank you.
~ladhut-docfyn [Dan Haffey] is in the building
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] frequently finds himself working at C
level
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] rarely ventures far below C level
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot; is in the building
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: i wonder if urbit will ever be able to run on
raspberri pis
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: I thought we had some people doing
that...
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Yebyeb, I believe.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: *yebyen
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: yebyeb is an Ewok greeting.
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot; has left the building
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: could also be an urbit user
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: we had someone run urbit on a pi like a month or
two ago
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: oh, ok
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: could you get a native version going, that ran
directly on the pi?
~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: Um, you could ssh from the pi to an Amazon EC2
instance and run it there.
~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: That&amp;#39;s totally not what you&amp;#39;re trying to do,
though.
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: okay, git pull again. the bug is actually
really fixed now.
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: (&amp;amp;&amp;amp; make, of course)
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: and magically, vere feels like a solid
piece of software.
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: I am looking at terminal history as
actually useful information, rather than just a string of lies.
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: my little vere: urbit is magic
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;  self-immolates
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: that was quick
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: No, that&amp;#39;s ~satfex&amp;#39;s schtick.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: The self-immolation part.
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: :-|
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: is potato a possible urbit ship name bit?
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;  imagines a glorious cyberpunk future where all the
cool kids are urbed in to their ships via raspberry-colored glasses
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] nearly got immolated once
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Bad Zen monk joke.
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: no, they&amp;#39;re all consonant-vowel-consonant
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] has left the building
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: in the back of a truck in Mexico...
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: how are these things supposed to be pronounced
anyway
~balweb-sarlyt [Mark Zavislak] is in the building
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Did any Tibetan politics percolate through your Zen
training, ~satfex?
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: is it just as in lojban? or IPA? or pseudo-english?
(though that&amp;#39;d be confusing and merge a lot of things)
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: I don&amp;#39;t think official standards have been
promulgated
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: the driver had stopped at a gas station.
someone in the back -- there were like eight of us, with one guy hanging on the
top -- decided t o fill up a gatorade bottle with gas. the bottle, sitting next
to me, had its lid fall off at some point. I was pretty freaked for... a while.

~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]  scrolls a bit
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: minimal, jpt4
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: they&amp;#39;re supposed to be pseudo-english
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: tom-sight ball-sen
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: also it wasn&amp;#39;t Zen training, it was
Modern Mindfulness training with a strong Zen flavor
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: yeah but then you get ambiguity
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: I would say tom seet ball sen
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: i think
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: tom-sit
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: is actually what i thought
first
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: fan tive rahl pen
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: i&amp;#39;m imagining a crazy urbit-using future
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: in which everyone laughs at past computes in museums
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: computes
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Thank you for the clarification, ~satfex.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: computilators
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: I&amp;#39;d settle for a future where people even
looked at computers in museums.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i&amp;#39;d settle for a future
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: we do have a computer history museum
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;oh man, they used the internet. the internet! what
were they thinking? how did that even hold itself together?&amp;quot;
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: &amp;quot;those nerds!&amp;quot;
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: you mean the one in Mt View? It&amp;#39;s pretty
nice.
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: psh, this desk is a computer history museum
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: My wife didn&amp;#39;t understand much of it, but
she understood I was /very/ excited.
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; is in the building
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: ello novrud
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: my old mac got eaten by rats but i still have an ibm
clone running win3.1, thing&amp;#39;s older than i am
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: devoured by rats, eh?
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: Hello tognex
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: but yeah. The general vein of thought
Urbit taps is &amp;quot;Picture the Internet, including the Web. Now imagine someone
built a system like that on purpose, instead of it just happening over a few
decades while people were pursung other goals.&amp;quot;

~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot; is in the building
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: well dondep, maybe it&amp;#39;ll even get built well. :P
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: I have some aesthetic disagreements about
urbit&amp;#39;s design choices. But I like its way of doing it better than everyone
else&amp;#39;s way of not do ing it.

~rigryx-sovrus &amp;quot;atax2a&amp;quot; has a few old Macs and an old NeXT slab.
~lidfeb-tabpub &amp;quot;graycoder&amp;quot; is in the building
~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc] has left the building
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: yep, when things get done, it&amp;#39;s not because they&amp;#39;re
the best possible things, but because they were done by whoever decided to do
the things
~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc] is in the building
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: those who hold passionate views about the
layout of the building are advised to start swinging hammers when the hammers
start swinging
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: but dondep, will urbit do its goal /well/?
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: I hope so!
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: but prediction is hard, especially about
the future.
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: i come today from an android tablet that is sshed into
another android tablet
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: voltron style
~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: Let nobody say that novrud doesn&amp;#39;t know how to
party.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: tognex, with sufficient uncertainty about the future
performance of the present system, different is already better.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: true
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: perhaps urbit will start a revolution
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: perhaps it won&amp;#39;t
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: novrud, were you the one to run Urbit from a Raspberry
Pi?
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]:  Even if the existing Urbitverse
doesn&amp;#39;t gain traction, perhaps a fork of it might (though less likely IMO; more
likely someone t akes Hoon/Nock and builds an OS better than Arvo, not just
forking existing Arvo and generating their own keys.

~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: ok, so arvo is the os, hoon is the programming
language, and nock is..?
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: The virtual machine
~rovsyp-hatbep [Aaron Beckerman] is in the building
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: As well as the model of computation, like the lambda
calculus for LISP machines, or register machines for C.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ladies and gentlemen
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: so you could make a nock processor? :P
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: fantyv - no, I believe I was the first to run urbit on
an arm machine though, unless someone else managed to run it...
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: without tripping over the bug 
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Yes!
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: :room is a little bit slow I sense
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: greetings, rovsyp
~lidfeb-tabpub &amp;quot;graycoder&amp;quot; has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: performance is not our specialty at the moment
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but that&amp;#39;s okay!
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: anyway
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: ...i can tell
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I had suggested such a thing
partly in jest, for the most part a hardware implementation of Nock would
apparently be more trouble than it&amp;#39;s worth (according to the experts)

~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: i mean, i can&amp;#39;t even see the stuff i&amp;#39;m entering in
real time
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: what are you on, tognex?  must be fairly slow
to not keep up with keystrokes
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: in any case
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the time is ~2014.1.15..03.00.26..2258
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: I suspect that once we get everything on
Nock, Nock will start to look chunky and stupid
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which means
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s time for our chat
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Only because it&amp;#39;s not echoing
back to you by default - when I type something on this destroyer, it shows up
on my other one prett y instantly

~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] would be really happy to live in a world
where Nock looked chunky and stupid
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] likes to say, silence from the peanut gallery
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but we&amp;#39;re all peanuts really
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but in any case
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: p.nuts
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I have some some announcements
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: first of all, in case you haven&amp;#39;t seen them,
chapters 7 and 8 of the Urbit doc are now available
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: covering some pretty basic basics of how Hoon
works
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: chapters 9 and 10 will complete most of the
core Hoon doc
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and should be released this week
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: second, in case you or anyone you know is in SF
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: tasfyn, you one of the main urbit devs?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yup I pretty much built this thing...
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot; salutes the Grand Admiral Yarvin.
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i dunno tasfyn, who are you again?
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot; is in the building
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: what are you doing here?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we are having a meetup next Monday
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: where de burger at?
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: &amp;quot;You might very well think that;
I couldn&amp;#39;t possibly comment.&amp;quot;
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: 7pm PST at Zeitgeist, a notorious biker bar
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: if any fans of other languages / platforms show
up, there may be a rumble
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: tognex, curtis has been building urbit since 202
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is aging but still pretty effective with a bike
chain
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: errr, 2002
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is not that old!
~wacrel-ripwes &amp;quot;Salo&amp;quot; is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: also, I spent 6 years on Nock, which is a page
of code and gzips to 350 bytes
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: but is still handy with a bike chain
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but admittedly there was a lot of surfing
during these years
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: in any case...
~minbec-wansyl [Michael (mhartl) Hartl] is in the building
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: boards or browsers?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: boards.  not very well, either.  also some
browsers :-)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Monday the 20th, Zeitgeist in SF, 7pm
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that&amp;#39;s ~2014.1.21..03.00.00 Urbit time
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: just so you know
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: it&amp;#39;s gonna be fun, we&amp;#39;ll laugh, we&amp;#39;ll drink,
we&amp;#39;ll pick a fight with the googlers
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: all four of the Tlon (the corporate tentacle of
Urbit) guys will be there
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so that&amp;#39;s cool
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett] is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: other cool stuff... we have successfully
auctioned off ~nyt, Fare&amp;#39;s _per fortuna_ carrier
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it went for 15.5 bitcoins
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which means the value of the entire Urbit
address space is 
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] (sub (mul 16 256) 128) 3.968
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: bitcoins
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which is according to our latest calculation
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: almost half the market cap of Dogecoin
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so it&amp;#39;s a start anyway.  also in other news
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: actually, there is good news and bad news
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the first piece of good news is that, as
promised (and as we warned our, you know, actual investors)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Tlon has donated 32 carriers to urbit.org, so
have I
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which gives us 64 for the vague goal of
promoting community spirit, etc, etc
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and the second piece of good news is that we
are distributing carriers to our faithful supporters
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the bad news unfortunately
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: is that if you&amp;#39;re receiving a carrier, you have
already been told so
~wacrel-ripwes &amp;quot;Salo&amp;quot; has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it being unfortunately necessary to draw a very
arbitrary line
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but let me go back to the beginning and explain
the process here
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the basic idea of urbit from an
economic/political standpoint
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: is that if we achieve world domination the
present price of a carrier
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: $12K or so by a very unscientific sample of 1
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: will go up by 3 to 4 orders of magnitude
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: on the other hand
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we are a long way from world domination
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we are a skeezy little prototype in some dark
alley of the internets
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there is a very long journey from prototype to
colossus
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: therefore an essential ingredient of the design
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: is to use the limited address space and its
potential value
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: to motivate development and developers
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: at least it motivated me to develop this crazy
thing
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so perhaps it can motivate others
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: if they&amp;#39;re as crazy as me at least
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but this is surprisingly more difficult than it
seems
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: because you don&amp;#39;t want to basically just use
this resource as money to pay people
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: money makes everything unfun
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this is open source
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it should be crazy and wild and cool and fun
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is crazy and wild and cool and fun
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: there should be a bit of wild-west to it
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: as there was to the original internets, of
course
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we are a tiny desperate insane underdog punk
cult
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: furthermore
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: an urbit carrier isn&amp;#39;t just a prize
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is not like bitcoin in that it&amp;#39;s just
something you own
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is also a duty and a trust
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: while the present governance mode of urbit is,
like most open source projects
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: it&amp;#39;s a seat in the imperial senate
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a ruthless absolute dictatorship
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: we can fiddle while the emperor burns
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we want it to scale
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: to scale it must become a republic, with
multipolar governance/
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: curtis, why are you saying all the things
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: so many lines ;_;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: u have to be able to read as fast as I can type
:-)
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: oh please, I can type seriously fast, and read
faster than I type
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: what&amp;#39;s the point of having dictators without
dictatorial speeches
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is not designed to require central authority
in any formal sense
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: but I come back a few inutes later and my entire
term window is full of your stuff
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: as it should be.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I forgot to mention
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that after I rant like a dictator for a number
of minutes
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: all we will have left is Q&amp;amp;A
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan] is using 191x55 terminal at 16pt
font with 1920x1080 res on 27&amp;quot; monitor
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but there is a little more ranting to go
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: with a generous tmus buffer
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: *x
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is also a fan of teh giant screens
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: in any case, hatteb is right
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the carriers are essentially a senate
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: in the good old Roman sense
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: an effective constitution is always one in
which formal and informal power are aligned
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the Roman Senate ceased to matter when the
Senators ceased to matter
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: according to the cryptographic structure of
urbit, however
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the carriers will always have a critical role
in collective governance
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so we want them to be mostly good people
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a few bad eggs, or even lost keys, the system
can bear
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but we don&amp;#39;t want it to turn into a
bureaucratic-corporate suitzone full of corrupt liars, like ICANN
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ideally all carriers will be held by distinct
individuals, whose personal responsibility is significant
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: corporate ownership is inevitable at this
stage, but in the long run frowned upon
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we are very into individuals
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; specifies Dual_EC-DRBG as the official urbit drbg.
Here, have these constants.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and if there is one word we would like to apply
to those individuals
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: (we currently roll our own with SHA256, which
is crude, but on the other hand, no mysterious government constants!)
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: well then
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that word is: virtuous
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: you should give me all your carriers ;D
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a government of virtuous individuals cannot
help but be virtuous
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: (you will have a chance to earn at least one!)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so in my dictatorial majesty I deliberated,
silently, on my mountaintop
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and then I decided, speaking from the balcony
like Mussolini,
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that the process would work like this:
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the qualifications for receiving a carrier from
urbit.org are: a demonstrated virtue.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the carriers will be distributed in rounds,
each round beginning when the last ends.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: in general, we favor early adopters, so the
sooner you join us the better you&amp;#39;ll do.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: heh, well, I&amp;#39;m 15. doubt I&amp;#39;m suited for carrier
ownership
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: (it is notable that out of the three round 1
winners who sold their carriers,
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: (that&amp;#39;s excellent - we are still waiting for
our first urbiter born in the 21st century)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: (but painfully close!)
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; is 27 and isn&amp;#39;t suited for carrier ownership!
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] went to college when he was 15, actually, so he
is very favorable toward young people who don&amp;#39;t know their place
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: out of the three who sold, anyway, the longer
they waited, the more money they got - hint hint
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but in any case, each round promotes a virtue
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: oh cool i&amp;#39;m not the only one. src, or?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: src, or?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: each round promotes a virtue
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the virtue to be promoted is announced *after*
the round, so you can&amp;#39;t guess
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: they are all classical or pseudo-classical
virtues
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: in the first round, carriers were issued to
people who submitted a Nock decrement in 2010
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: in 2010 I posted Nock on the internets and said
that anyone who wrote a decrement would receive a prize
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the prize turned out to be worth, as of present
writing, 15.5 bitcoins
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: guess not. src = college exclusively for people who
start college early
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: oh Simon&amp;#39;s Rock, I know of it
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: no, I started at Hopkins and transferred to
Brown
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: in any case
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: these people demonstrated a very important
virtue
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the virtue of Fortune, aka, luck
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and their carriers are marked &amp;quot;per fortuna&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] only goes to sea surrounded by lucky people
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but that was then and this is now
~minbec-wansyl [Michael (mhartl) Hartl]: velut luna, statu variabilis
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and the virtue we are rewarding today
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: is another important classical virtue much
neglected in our age
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Loyalty - or, in Latin, fidelis
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: basically the people who received carriers
today
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: are the people who have been showing up,
dealing with bugs, chatting, programming, learning, etc, etc
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: for the past 3 months while everything has gone
from totally broken to, well, a working chat server
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and we have really nothing else to reward
~wacrel-ripwes &amp;quot;Salo&amp;quot; is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: because it hasn&amp;#39;t really been possible to make
the community contribute useful changews
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: because our language doc is still not quite
done, etc, etc
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there have been some useful changes, amazingly,
but not much
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I cannot disclose of course the virtue that
will be rewarded in the next round
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but it will certainly involve doing Useful
Stuff
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: in some sense of the word
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: 
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is also important to note
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that one of the rules of the Festival of
Virtues
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: for so we call it
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: i qualify as a young person who doesnt know their
place in life :p
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: is that anyone who already owns a carrier is
ineligible for the actual prize, though they still receive the honor
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: anyway, keep on talking about your carrier plans
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: young man, you have already taken the right
first step!
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but in any case...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I should actually list the winners
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is more decorous to do so by their destroyer
names:
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]:   ~difryt-dapdeg ~boswed-nibnyd ~racbes-solmun~lontec-botrum ~rigryx-sovrus
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]:  ~novrud-hanweb ~radred-bitlet ~bishus-namsum~nimtep-dibteb ~hobmed-hinrym
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]:   ~bitfer-worwyd ~talsur-todres ~tomsyt-balsen~nocheb-talren ~rovsyp-hatbep
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]:  ~nibbus-sivnex ~dovwyn-hobsub
~nocheb-talren is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and these are the ranks of the faithful, etc,
etc
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which is not to say that others are faithless
~wacrel-ripwes &amp;quot;Salo&amp;quot; has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is simply that it is now too late to win a
carrier for mere loyalty
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: 
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: furthermore, imagine how horrible it would be
if we were to announce that in 6 months
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: records of your loyalty would be reviewed and
further carriers would be issued to those with demonstrated loyalty
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: let&amp;#39;s just say it would profoundly kill the
buzz
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and we try not to do that
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: thus, we cannot offer any details about the
next virtue to be rewarded
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: except that it will be something useful :-)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and those who have received carriers for
loyalty will hopefully continue to display it, but if they don&amp;#39;t
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there is nothing we can or will do about it
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: thank you for this honor!
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; was envisioning something with ninjas.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: (well, technically we could, but it would
impair the integrity of Urbit)
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Like what happens when the hoon parser sees an ASCII 9
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: so how can I help urbit?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] takes this moment to thank everyone who has
shown up and contributed
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: can you code?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: probably, or you wouldn&amp;#39;t be here
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: hear! hear!
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;:  arditi ninjas toting vials of castor oil, in
keeping with the theme
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]  salutes the new captains of the imperial
fleet
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you can learn the system and apply your fresh
youthful perspective to it
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there will be much to be done, relatively soon
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: nope, i can&amp;#39;t code worth beans
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;  can&amp;#39;t code but knows he should fix that
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that&amp;#39;s fine, y&amp;#39;all can learn!
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: i&amp;#39;m in the same boat as dolrux, metaphorically
speaking
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: Speaking for ~lontec-botrum, who is with us in spirit,
thanks!
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: our great advantage here is that there is
nothing to unlearn
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: those who can code basically have to unlearn
half the things they now
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: know
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: your minds are fresh, untainted with the 20th-century
perspectives.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: because this system is just plain weird.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: exactly.
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: And if you can&amp;#39;t code Hoon after reading
the doc, that&amp;#39;s a bug in either Hoon or the doc, not you...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] loves using &amp;quot;20th-century&amp;quot; as a pejorative.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that&amp;#39;s exactly right, the customer is never
wrong
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: yeah, I wonder if urbit is /too/ weird, honestly
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is really not a very complex system and if
it seems scary, we&amp;#39;re doing it wrong
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: well, the idea is that young people are the
future and weird attracts young people
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: seems to mostly work
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: No computer has ever failed to run a
program for being too weird, so far as I know.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: what about graphical applications and such? shiny
GUIs, and games?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: with some exceptions...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we are a long way from that
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and quite intentionally
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: someone should really right a MUD for urbit
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the neat thing about the niche of personal
cloud computing
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: *write, not right
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: stupid fingers
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: is that the shiny chrome stuff is neither
needed nor wanted
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we&amp;#39;re really just serving web pages like very
other back end
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: all the shiny is in the browser
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a lot of people (Alan Kay comes to mind) who
have tried the total rewrite
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: so who is urbit /made/ for?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: have gotten stuck on this giant bolus of work
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: end users, or backend people?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that depends what year it is
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you ask excellent questions, young man, you
ought to be a VC
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: in the year 2014, urbit is for: geeks.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; is interested in writing a MU* for urbit, in fact.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: who bought an Apple II in 1982?  certainly not
anyone who needed an Apple II.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it was a new computing form factor
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: a VC?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: venture capitalist
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan] can betatest the heck out of MU*&amp;#39;s
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Charlie don&amp;#39;t invest.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: ha
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: in the beginning, there were BBSes, MUDs, and
pre-IRC chats...
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: yes. MUDs were my gateway into the
hilarious netherworld of distributed systems software.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but in any case, basically, for examples of
people using cloud computers
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you have apps like Buffer
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which is a multigazillion funded VC business
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which exists to run a cron job that posts your
tweets to Twitter
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: heh
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so a lot of people have in a sense cloud
computers
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: how did you learn to code, tasfyn?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but there are basically two kinds of cloud
computers
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: taught myself on a 3B1 with a 10Mhz 68010 :-)
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: heh
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there are general-purpose cloud computers and
special-purpose ones
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Buffer is a special-purpose cloud computer, so
is Facebook
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: somebody else owns your data, controls your
programs, owns your identity
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: how would you learn to code these days?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this kind of sucks especially if you&amp;#39;re a
privacy freak
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Start with Nock!
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I can recommend only one system, which is the
one you&amp;#39;re using
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Nock doc rocks, ~tognex.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: all others fail our highly technical quality
test
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: unix system programming is not any fun to teach
anyone.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there is another kind of cloud computer
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: well, i might like something usable for end users
within the next ten years
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s the linux box you can get at DO or AWS
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] is going as fast as he can...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s great if you&amp;#39;re a linux sysadmin and enjoy
doing that in your spare time
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: It&amp;#39;s fun in the &amp;quot;and you&amp;#39;ll never believe
*this*&amp;quot; sense of teaching people things.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but the advantage of Urbit
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: is that it&amp;#39;s both as general-purpose as the
Linux box
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and as simple as the special-purpose things
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: OMG.  A 3B1.  My parents had a (I think) 3B1.
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: behold:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Atandt_unix_pc.jpg
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the whole stack from nock up to the OS is well
under 15000 lines of code
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: has anyone seen any blues, or am the onlly blue on
urbit
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;  learned to program on the Univac 70/46 at the local
college.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: *am i the
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s quite possible that you&amp;#39;ve stumbled into a
hive of dangerous heretics, tognex
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] is not really %black, but is spying on the
%black channel
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but that is neither here nor there and you
don&amp;#39;t need to worry about it!
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: &amp;quot;Trust half of what you see and none of
what you hear.&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you&amp;#39;re probably looking for some other droids.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: all i need is a little bit of
time and i will understand hoon
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: heh, I&amp;#39;m fairly sure this is the conspiracy I came
for.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: in any case
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: everyone loves conspiracies especially the
younger set
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: yes
~rigryx-sovrus &amp;quot;atax2a&amp;quot;: You came here looking for us? We&amp;#39;re flattered. And now
you&amp;#39;re implicated... ;)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and come on, you already have a secret codename
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: what could go wrong?
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: LOL
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: cabal-oriented development is what spurred
my interest in open source.
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;  learned to program in QuickBASIC on an IBM clone
running win3.1 about ten years ago
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but in any case, the way urbit will work for
the ordinary user
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: is that all the 15 or 20 web apps you use on a
regular basis now
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: will cease to exist
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;  forgot all that, which is probably for the best
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: they will become without form and void
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: weeping and gnashing of teeth will be heard on
Sand Hill Road
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: good
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: except of course for the prescient investors
who presciently invested in us instead
~monder-navryx &amp;quot;LarryH&amp;quot;: amen
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: tumblr is one of the webapps
i use
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: and i hate it
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and instead of these webapps
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: yeah tasfyn, I&amp;#39;m seriously doubting the sanity of
urbit, but what&amp;#39;s the fun in a sane conspiracy?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you will run your own demons
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: on your own ship
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which serves only you
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i don&amp;#39;t think anyone but
dolrux can understand how much i hate tumblr
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: &amp;quot;as a service&amp;quot; is 2014&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;dot tumblr dot
com&amp;quot;.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which has only your data
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which is yours
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: labfes, tumblr should have its own banner to contain
the insanity
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: sure, it&amp;#39;s hosted, but you could also host it
yourself
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: or move it between providers
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: because it&amp;#39;s yours
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and when you want to change the program you&amp;#39;re
running
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you just do that
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and... and this only works, critical point
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: if we can leverage the simplicity of the
architecture
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: to make system administration *absolutely
trivial*
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: Huzzah!
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: owning an urbit ship should be as easy as
managing your iphone, if not easier
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so this is basically the personal use case
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: can we get it to run on a
mobile device
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: will there be a touchscreen
UI
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: The serverside shouldn&amp;#39;t.
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i&amp;#39;ve got a nice ssh app on my iphone
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so eventually, once you have these ships in the
cloud
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: &amp;lt;- comes to you from an android today
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: once world domination is achieved or at least
threatened on the server side
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: you probably _could_, if you&amp;#39;re energetic
enough. But the idea is that an urbit ship is your agent in a datacenter
somewhere
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: some amount of cutting through the browser on
the client will be inevitable
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: heh, plotting world domination already
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you&amp;#39;ll have a destroyer on the server and then,
later, a yacht (64-bit ship) on the client
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; keeps reminding people: everyone has a web browser and
an email address.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is 40, he needs to hurry up with that sh*t
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but as hatteb said
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: and your android device is both short of
battery and intermittent of connection, and you usually want some service
running on your behalf on something further from the network edge.

~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] is interested in doing the cloud on your
phone, some day...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the first step is to take advantage of the
network effect of existing networks
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: 40 is the new 20.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: so http
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so, basically, your ship serves http apps to
you
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: a way to transfer files easily between urbit users
would be nice
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: what about clouds in my coffee?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: heh, this is not only nice but trivial
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: if you&amp;#39;ve seen the video
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: then again, you&amp;#39;d probably attract all the pirates
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: urbit is a global namespace
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; is one of those maniacs that has an IRC editor. :)
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: ever
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you really ought to be a VC, young man
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: when you grow up of course 
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: is there a toolkit for
defining http services
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: or will we need to build one
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but in this global namespace you can use files
on other peoples ships just by using them
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there is but it&amp;#39;s somewhat prototypic
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this is %eyre, arvo/eyre.hoon
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: ok so we&amp;#39;ll need to build
from it
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it serves a little toy app but it&amp;#39;s somewhat of
a toy
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] wants his web apps to be as easy to edit and run
as php.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i want easier
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: there was a guy in the pre-compuserve days who said
he&amp;#39;d figure that the whole modem thing was useful when he could go on his
computer and look up a nything he might want to know about manatees

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: how could we be easier?
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: well for one: screw html
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: in any case, I don&amp;#39;t expect to attract pirates
at first
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: anyway, I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m rich enough to be a
venture capitalist, tasfyn
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: oh yes, you can generate html easily as simply
a noun
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: heh, you use other peoples&amp;#39; money
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: letters of marque and reprisal?
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: and in the other case, our network is slow enough to
not make piracy easy.
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: ...i forget where i was going with that
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: At the current moment, at least.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes - it&amp;#39;s basically not as good a BitTorrent
as BitTorrenty
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: anyway everyone&amp;#39;s doing this
RESTful BS these days
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: if BT didn&amp;#39;t exist we might have a problem
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: yes, but you have to convince people to give you
their money
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: that&amp;#39;s the hard part
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes, this requires social connections
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you have to get to know people who know people
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you know me and I know people, so...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: actually you should consider applying for a
Thiel Fellowship at some point 
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: tomsyt-balsen is a veteran of this program
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: if you&amp;#39;re not cool enough you have 5 years to
become more cool
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: still has the scars
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but you&amp;#39;re here so you must be cool eh.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: anyway my 40-year-old wrists are getting tired
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: if anyone has any technical questions from
reading the doc
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: or questions about the carrier distribution
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; &amp;#39;s wrists are unhappy too :(
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] would be pleased to entertain them.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hatteb, just you wait.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: pfft, I&amp;#39;m not going to become a loyal servant of the
cultspiracy of urbit just because you said I was cool :P
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: sitting wrong kills wrists
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you can say that, but...
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: I do have one question, lemme go find tha deets...
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: one of my friends has
invincible wrists
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] knows very well how to run a cult.
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;:  labfes, replacing the html/css/js hell would be an
interesting exercise
~ladhut-docfyn [Dan Haffey]: could you give a micro-summary of tiles for the
doc-impatient?
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Off-topic: When is your birthday, ~tasfyn?
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: there are people who use normal sensible things like
linux and python who think I&amp;#39;m cool :P
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: heh.
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: would probably take a few decades to work it out,
but, hey, you know
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a tile is a structured way to create a noun of
a well-known type
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;  wonders if there&amp;#39;s an existing format that could be
used to replace it
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a tile is used either for (a) creating a
default noun, (b) applying type to an untyped noun, (c) a pattern matching test
~ladhut-docfyn [Dan Haffey]: awesome, thanks
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;  is reminded of the scene from the American &amp;quot;Office&amp;quot; where
Creed Bratton allows as how cults are fun -- being a leader is good, but a lot
of work, and bei ng a member has its good points too, or words to that effect.

~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: dolrux, once we come up with
a way to build native UIs easily
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this will be the next doc output, give me a day
or two
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: you know what I&amp;#39;d like? a really, really good
terminal
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: as for the native UIs
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;  thought of svg and is now cackling maniacally
imagining that
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] dreams of sending only SVG over the nets
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: one wth features like a list of files to the right,
or something
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;  isn&amp;#39;t even sure if that&amp;#39;d be better or worse
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but SVG compatibility she is not so great
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: svg is a monster of a format
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes, we&amp;#39;ll basically have a web
dashboard/console
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: interactivity is the punch in
the crotch
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: one made not to resemble a teletype terminal
intentionally, but be new and better.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: j a v a s c r i p t
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: to control your ship not using SSH or whatever
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: &amp;lt;troll&amp;gt;we can always use VRML&amp;lt;/troll&amp;gt;
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: someone had the bright idea that xml was just
perfect for vector graphics
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: xml (^:
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is probably too old to know how to reinvent the
terminal - but yes.
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: for all x someone had the bright idea that xml was
just perfect for x
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] cut his teeth on the vt100.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: having multiple ways to add
properties to object structure isn&amp;#39;t normal, but on xml it is
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; does know that Xterm has a vector-display emulator...
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: xml: not even once
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I actually was reading Usenet on an
amber-screen VT100 in 1988
~ladhut-docfyn [Dan Haffey]: dolrux, I was typing almost the same thing :)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yeah, xml and vector graphics == hilarious fit
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: okay, we have no critical questions
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: everyone in my family works in tech, and once every
two weeks or so one of them brings back a new xml horror story
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: there was an amusing bug in
the JVM, speaking of XML, recently
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: which we discovered because
apparently all the AWS apis use XML
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: i&amp;#39;m gonna be going a bit idle. good luck with urbit,
tasfyn! maybe it&amp;#39;ll be the future, maybe not. maybe something similar will be.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]:  dolrux, hopefully one day Alan Kay will
disgorge the work his team has been working on for the past few years, he&amp;#39;s
basically been doing for graphics/UIs what Urbit is doing for
cloud/distributed/server stuff

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is going to go home, put his kids to bed and ice
his wrists :-)
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: (i.e., a rewrite from foundations)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: he encourages the conversation to continue!
~monder-navryx &amp;quot;LarryH&amp;quot;: ~tasfyn, did i read in one of the logs that there is a
known problem with getting notified of updates to the file system
~minbec-wansyl [Michael (mhartl) Hartl]:  Have a good night
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: Good night, Curtis!  Thanks again!
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: actually I say that, I know some of it&amp;#39;s
public... hunting for it
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: monder-navryx you read that right
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: so basically there was a
security feature the java devs added to prevent XML entity expansion attacks
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: quitting and restarting vere will always get
it, though...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: anyway, good night!
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Vale, Czyarvin.
~monder-navryx &amp;quot;LarryH&amp;quot;: have tried that, will try again
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: night!
~balweb-sarlyt [Mark Zavislak]: Have a great night ~tasfyn, my kid needs to get
to bed too.
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: night
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: so they put a cap of 6400
expansion by default. however, the broken part ...
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: was that they were using a
GLOBAL VARIABLE to count up how many expansions had been done!
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: bonsoir
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: so there could only be 6400
expansions during the lifetime of the JVM!
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has left the building
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: ahaha 
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: 6400 should be enough for anybody
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: heh! i&amp;#39;m the youngest in the cultspiracy of urbit,
probably
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan] might still be the oldest
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;:   ~tognex, you have competition.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: oh?
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;:   It will probably come down to the difference of a few
months.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: well then
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: how old are you?
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: DMT beats me by five years, I
gratefully relinquish the crown
~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc] has left the building
~nocheb-talren has left the building
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: fantyv, how old are you?
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: 
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: No fear from me, I was born right after the fall of the
USSR.
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;:  my first memory is hearing about the breakup of
yugoslavia
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: who&amp;#39;s my competition, then?
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: No idea.  My early memories involve hearing about the
Kennedy assasination.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Haven&amp;#39;t seen them on in a while.
~minbec-wansyl [Michael (mhartl) Hartl] has left the building
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: My earliest memories consist of trying to climb out
of a crib.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Goes by the name of Setra.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: I&amp;#39;m fairly sure they&amp;#39;re real.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; remembers an earthquake in California dominating news
coverage.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: And a lot of familial stuff not worth recounting.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: All memories are real. Whether they are of real things
is another question.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: my earliest memories are
about a nightmare i used to have
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: heh, I&amp;#39;m pretty sure it was of a real thing
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Do you remember that time we were on Urbit?
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: The one where dinosaurs stalk your church and you have
to run away from them by sneaking around the back to make a dash to the parking
lot, but everythi ng seemed to be going in slow motion?

~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: That nightmare?
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: it involved getting eaten
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: atax1a, November of 2013.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: by a piece of wall furniture
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Quick question, was my last post prepended with &amp;quot;...&amp;quot;?
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: No.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: That&amp;#39;s a terminal artefact.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: just ignore the ellipsis...
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Very curious, it looks like &amp;quot;... atax1a, November of
2013&amp;quot;.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: that&amp;#39;s my policy anyway
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Yes, I suspect xterm strangeness.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: It&amp;#39;s probably not xterm.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: The ... is :chat waiting on an ack from ~doznec, so i
hear.
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;:  yeah if it&amp;#39;s there when you hit enter it&amp;#39;ll look
like it&amp;#39;s there when it sends
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: since it just bumps whatever&amp;#39;s on the bottom up one,
i think
~rovsyp-hatbep [Aaron Beckerman] has left the building
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Interesting.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: yeah, the ... is waiting for a server reply
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i&amp;#39;m thinking of running through some project
euler problems in hoon
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: It seems like a good fit.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: hoon is the high-level part, right?
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Hoon is the systems language.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Hoon : Nock :: C : Assembly
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: Ok.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: so hoon is the highest level?
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: So far.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: I really do recommend learning Nock first.
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: I agree
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; tried the other way, it doesn&amp;#39;t work so well.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: how hard is nock?
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Are you familiar with binary trees?
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: nope
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; has left the building
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: i don&amp;#39;t really know much code
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: No need to know code, tree manipulation is the
mechanical explanation of what nock does.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: A binary tree is a graph composed of a set of points
(equivalently, nodes) and lines.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: There is a single root node, which can connect to at
most two child nodes.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: These child nodes are the parents of up to at most two
child nodes.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Like so:     Root
/    \
ch ild  child

~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: These nodes have indexes, numbers which identify their
address within the tree.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: E.g.       Root                                  /    \
child  child                   becomes      0                      / \
1   2

~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Hopefully that looks ok on your screen.
~ladhut-docfyn [Dan Haffey]: the root is 1
~ladhut-docfyn [Dan Haffey]: if you&amp;#39;re talking / indexes
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Thank you, ~ladhut.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: If you have never encountered trees or other data
structures, the only action that will be of much help is to go and learn them,
for which Nock is quite suitable.

~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: k
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: If you do, then the mantra that Nock is a way to
manipulate binary trees of integers helps to burn away the mysticism.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: i see...
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; is in the building
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: There is also a correspondence between trees and lists.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: What do you see: ()
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: i see that i need to learn trees
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: who here likes to cook
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot; enjoys en masse jumbalaya production.
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]:  @was a stunning cook, now a
stunning primal cook
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: who screws up half his emotes
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: it&amp;#39;s like 5 past 23 here and
i&amp;#39;m cooking up some bacon some sweet potato oven fries and some eggs
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Stunningly primal good sir
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: i like to cook
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; has left the building
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: we got to hold another urbit meetup
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: from 2014-01-22 on
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: going afk for a moment
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; is in the building
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Do I interpret your proposal, ~racbes, to mean the
establishment of a Perpetual Urbit Party?
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: *your proposal correctly
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;What: Party Where: Urbit When: 2014-01-22 til ?&amp;quot;
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: that&amp;#39;s right
~ladhut-docfyn [Dan Haffey]: ain&amp;#39;t no party like a west coast party
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: it can have like intervals...
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: I hesitate to define a particular interval
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: The Party of the Institutionalized Urbivolution.
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: but clearly urbit must colonize additional times and
places
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: in addition to Zeitgeist on 2014-01-20 
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: ahhh, back
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Transportation costs would be the limiting factor for
me.
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: first, Mr. Dee and I are going to armwrestle for our
respective monastic traditions
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: I don&amp;#39;t know who&amp;#39;s holding the bets
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: helping someone through urbit over skype is
interesting
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: do you know if :game is working ~tomsyt?
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i kept wanting to grab the keyboard
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: but there was no keyboard
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: does it say waiting?
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: no... type fail
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: ah, you need to run &amp;quot;game&amp;quot; and then a string
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: i read it as taking a tape...
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: :game &amp;quot;elvis&amp;quot;
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: should work
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: that works for you?
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: i get a type-fail down in hume... wanted to make sure it
wasn&amp;#39;t just me
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: ...no, that&amp;#39;s bizarre
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: that should work though

~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Once Urbit has games, we can form UGGs - Urbit Gamer
Guilds.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: And with our UGGs, we can play in the MUD.
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i&amp;#39;m stumped

~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: it&amp;#39;s a language change propagation error
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: as in, cgy changed something in hoon
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: ah.. that was my guess
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and hasn&amp;#39;t changed game
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: okay guys, i&amp;#39;m heading out for the night
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: i don&amp;#39;t remember seeing any app level changes...

~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: is this what we&amp;#39;re supposed

~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: bring cheese?
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: or similar things?
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: no, I am uniquely cheese-privileged

~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; not responding still trying
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Yeah, I had shut down the n&amp;amp;
earlier when it was stuck on ...&amp;#39;ing
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: maybe it&amp;#39;s novrud that needs restarting
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: i&amp;#39;m writing a -p into v/main.c
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: does anyone know what -k and -f do
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: -k is &amp;quot;boot stage&amp;quot;, an int between 0 and 256
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: so, a char-sized int
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: -f is only allowed to be a max of 100 but is
undocumented
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: sorry, 0&amp;lt;f&amp;lt;100 not max of 100
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; is in the building

~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I&amp;#39;m rebuilding vere right now in case some c leaks
were fixed
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: You can run it but you&amp;#39;ll be waiting about 30 more
seconds
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: two more seconds
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: All is well
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: More or less
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; has left the building
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: you need to use atol if you want to parse a port

~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; is in the building
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: does anyone here know what a c3_w is
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: w must stand for word
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: 3 could stand for 3 omitted letters
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: so it could be, say, &amp;quot;cuss_word&amp;quot;
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: well, let&amp;#39;s find out if I did it even remotely
right...
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: so I think I absorbed some of the hoon
docs.
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; has left the building
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: here&amp;#39;s the understanding I reached:
http://bpaste.net/show/0g37DQKdPwtJkq1oondD/
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: Remotely right is about where it&amp;#39;s at!
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: cool
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I&amp;#39;m working in c right now
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: always fun
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; is in the building
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: the nice thing about C is that it&amp;#39;s so bad
nobody expects you to do it without reasonable tools.
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: include/c/types.h:11:      typedef uint32_t c3_w;
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: 80:   typedef unsigned int      uint32_t;
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: appears to be an unsigned in
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: int
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: oh perfect
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: just enough to store a long port number
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; has left the building
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: so it takes my param to -p
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: but it complains that the pier is already created,
like I passed in -c
~wacrel-ripwes &amp;quot;Salo&amp;quot; is in the building
~wacrel-ripwes &amp;quot;Salo&amp;quot; has left the building
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: ok, so it actually did work
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: i just had to recompile a bit more than I thought I
did
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: make clean &amp;amp;&amp;amp; make -j4
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: and I can still get a random port by not passing in -p
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: great!

at a time, though.
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: here we go, detaching...
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: and we&amp;#39;re back.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: dash, it&amp;#39;s &amp;amp; yes | no, not &amp;amp; true | false. :)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] does not fear the DO.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: although their &amp;quot;private networking&amp;quot; option is

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] admires dondep&amp;#39;s pastebin, although ^-  is

~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; has left the building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; reads ^- as &amp;quot;returns this type&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] always says &amp;quot;produces,&amp;quot; never says &amp;quot;returns&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] isn&amp;#39;t sure why
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but with ^-, we of course have to test that the
thing it produces without the ^-  matches the actual product
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this is ++nest which will be explained in
chapter 10
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; ...in what base
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so it is not a weak cast in the C sense, it is
fully type safe
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: all your base is belong to tasfyn-partyv.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; uses base 10, but can only count up to 3
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] left octal out of his syntax
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: probably a good thing - nobody uses octal, and it
confuses newcomers.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the word is cool, though.  octal.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it could be a hipster baby name.
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; is in the building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: it&amp;#39;s five letters, though.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: %octl
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] didn&amp;#39;t give either of his kids four-letter
names, he&amp;#39;s not sure why
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: at some point he&amp;#39;ll have to break the bad news
that they don&amp;#39;t fit in a c3_w
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: The horror.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Henry and Sibyl, correct? Drop the (canonical) vowels
and it works.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but the four-letter words don&amp;#39;t drop vowels -
once you start abbreviating it never stops.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: %o
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: So, last era I had a :thumb that would read your bud&amp;#39;s
plan. But I never got it to type as a tape correctly.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: It seemed more like a *&amp;#39;&amp;#39;, which makes me think of
tainted data in a perly sense.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the file itself would be a big ass atom
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is certainly not a tape (list of
characters), that would be insanely bulky
~ladhut-docfyn [Dan Haffey] has left the building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: of course.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: but my dot-plan is a file containing utf8 text, in
something like the old unix tradition.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes.  it makes a fine atom.  any file is an
atom./
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ++lore will split your file up into a list of
spans, one for each line
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: oho.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: actually looking at ++lore is a good simple
little hoon exercise
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; has left the building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: those cut and end functions scare me a bit. 
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: but i grok turn, and envision the |= as a pair of
wires being wrapped around some data :)
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; peeked forward and read role...
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: cut and end are thoroughly jet propelled, in
case you worry that they&amp;#39;re slow
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#39;t worry about speed.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] doesn&amp;#39;t do speed, he sticks with caffeine
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: they are used a lot, and i don&amp;#39;t yet understand what
/for/.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: he used to have a big bottle of ephedrine when
you could get that
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: cut and end are bit surgery with an adjustable
block size
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: (cut 3 [a b] c) == give me the bytes starting
at a, for a length of b, from c
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: pick out pieces of atoms, then?
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: oho.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: why 3?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: 3 == bytes
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: (1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; 3) == 8
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: oh dang
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: okay
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there are 8 bits in a byte
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: there are indeed
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: 0 == bits
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: 13 == Kbytes
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: etc.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: so that gets bex&amp;#39;d to make the block size
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: gotcha/
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: those who talk don&amp;#39;t know, those who know don&amp;#39;t
talk
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; tries to figure out what ^+ and ^= do, now...
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ^=  a  b is just the regular form of a=b
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ^+ is a cast to a twig instead of a tile
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: tile doc coming soon
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; vaguely recalls mention of the regular form in the twig
doc...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it will all form a beautiful picture in your
mind
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: So, lore: given an atom, produce a list of lines - if
the atom is 0, reverse the accumulated list, otherwise recursively do bit
surgery.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: (accumulating into a list, of course)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes we accumulate in reverse for obvious
reasons
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it hardly matters because you see the ~/ there
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: right.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the jet is on
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: hello again tasfyn
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: hi tognex
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: good morning tognex
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s morning here, where are you?
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: morning :)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you&amp;#39;re not another of those Indiana kids are
you?
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: at a place where it&amp;#39;s 11:40 am
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: ha, nope
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Mountain time!
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ah, denver.  go buy some weed for me, there&amp;#39;s a
good boy.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: not denver. idaho :U
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: no weed, but I can get you some potatoes?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: idaho is much cooler actually
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: oh?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has fantasies of moving his family to idaho to
escape from the moral decay of san francisco
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: moral decay?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but really his kids would just grow up smoking
meth instead of weed.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a couple of months ago I was coming out the
front door of Tlon Global Headquarters
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a block from the Twitter building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: dude was in my way, in the doorway
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: shooting heroin
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; would try meth, if e knew e could just do it once.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: literally with a blood filled needle in his arm
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I&amp;#39;m like, dude, I kinda need to get through
here...
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: shrug
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: but, if i did, i&amp;#39;d do it &amp;#39;once&amp;#39; over the course of 6
months, and... no good.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] will become a heroin addict on his deathbed.
maybe with some meth thrown in.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] 
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: people can slowly kill themselves however they want,
imo
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] &amp;#39;s kids go to school two blocks away, he has to
explain the shambling zombies to a 3 year old
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s a very interesting phenomenon
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: how did you hear about urbit, tognex?
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: from a friend
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; did too.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you&amp;#39;re checking the &amp;quot;on the internets&amp;quot; box
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: where did this friend come from?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] wants people to hear about urbit the same way
they get their weed
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: shrug, it was a guy i know in a private irc channel
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the buzzword would be virally rather than
through a media push
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; is in the building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: oooh, people still use irc?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that would definitely be viral transmission
which is ideal
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: showed me the documentation to laugh at the oddity
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot; is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hatteb is joking fyi
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: heh, figured as much
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that&amp;#39;s exactly how it should work
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; is pleased that young&amp;#39;uns are on the IRCs, though.
Especially when the IRCs lead to urbit :chat.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: young geeks are always looking for something
that isn&amp;#39;t boring and lame
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: exactly
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] remembers the greatness of Usenet, tognex has
probably never heard of it
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: PFFT
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: i&amp;#39;ve heard of usenet.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] was posting on usenet in 1989 when he was
tognex&amp;#39;s age.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: i do know a bit of computer history.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: unfortunately he didn&amp;#39;t realize that records
would be kept
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I know about ancient Rome too, but I never went
there
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: what&amp;#39;s most depressing is the way it turned
into a sewer of pr0n binaries
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; missed usenet and became part of the Eternal September.
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I grew up on IRC, with the programmers of
enlightenment 
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] used to maintain the group killfile for his
favorite newsgroup
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but that was when you could kill them one by
one
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: i never would have found out about urbit without
minecraft, actually
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a rifle was sufficient
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] would love to have something like a minecraft
server on his urbits
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: minecraft and DF have the true ethos of
computing I grew up with
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: DF == Dwarf Fortress
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: a long, long time ago, I went to the minecraft
modding irc channel
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: and my life was forever ruined/enhanced, depending
on who you ask.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: yeah, I know what dwarf fortress is, I&amp;#39;ve even
played it :P
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: do you go to high school, tognex?  or are you
homeschooled?
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; is in the building
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: homeschooled
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: how did I know that?
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: in high school, i ran a proxy to avoid the pervasive
filtering by the district.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: is it christian homeschooling or hippie
homeschooling?
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: christian homeschooling
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: oof.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: of the not very existent sort. mostly, I teach
myself things!
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: Curtis, did you or John look at my c change in that
PR#108
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: not-so-oof!
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which has its merits, but they are probably
hard to see at your age
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: which... i&amp;#39;m kinda lazy about.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: john also was homeschooled at your age, look
how he turned out
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: you can at least tell yourself that you&amp;#39;re learning
urbit, right?
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I&amp;#39;m worried that&amp;#39;s not the right way to get a command
line argument
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: mostly because I don&amp;#39;t know how the optargs part works
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] was sent to an American high school as a
12-year-old sophomore, it was completely insane
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] will look at the change when he finishes
interrogating tognex
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; takes a look at satnum&amp;#39;s PR.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: so are you the main urbit person?
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: that&amp;#39;s fine
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes, indeed I built this crazy thing pretty
much
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it was entirely my project until this summer
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: it&amp;#39;s the -p port option we were talking about
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: i tried to follow your lead with -k
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: what is the option for, satnum?  refresh my
memory
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: my network has (I thought we proved) a strange rule
that says ports 59000-60000 are special UDP ports
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: allowed, where the others are silently dropped
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you can also see other my dangerous internet
cult being attacked here:
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]:
http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/22/geeks-for-monarchy/
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: satnum, that looks reasonable to me.
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: so it was an option to pick the port that ames listens
on
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: hatteb, thanks
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s obviously ideal if you can join both cults
at the same time.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: gotcha
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] trusts hatteb&amp;#39;s judgment.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: haha, you actually call it a dangerous internet
cult?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has great faith in the powers of satire.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: knew I shouldn&amp;#39;t trust urbit. weird terms and alien
documentation!
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: always trust content from Tlon Corporation
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: martians are your neighbors
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: not like those far away alians
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but it really is the case that both arms of my
plot for world domination are now doing... something
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: don&amp;#39;t trust folks from Uranus
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: one arm is making an art project, and the other is
stirring up neoreaction.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: or so say the detractors.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: world domination is an ugly phrase
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is good to be understated by the enemy
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: you should aim for world optimization
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] grew up a Washington brat and always likes to
ask people in that culture
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: people keep asking if urbit is going to make computers
more intuitive
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: &amp;quot;what exactly is the difference between
providing global governance and seizing world domination?&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the Paypal mafia with which I&amp;#39;m sort of
remotely connected introduced the &amp;quot;world domination&amp;quot; meme
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] also has a Darth Vader action figure which his
wife gave him for Christmas
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: what is the goal of urbit
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: world domination of course!
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I made this great ruby thing using inotify and tail
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: mhmm. and what&amp;#39;s the reason behind that goal?
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I&amp;#39;m really proud of it! Called logblaster... no
laughing
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the world is always dominated by someone or
something
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: at present it is dominated by two things
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: one, software from the 1970s
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: two, government from the 1930s
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: both of these things were very old when I was
young
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I am no longer young and they still seem old
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and they do not taste good to me
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Software from the 1970s is fascinating in a morbid
sort of way
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: they seem a little stale, funky, been in the
fridge too long
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so why not clean the fridge eh?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: besides it&amp;#39;s my nature as a rootless
cosmopolitan international Jew
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: to disrupt every stable social system I find
myself in
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: be careful not to take out all the shelves, mmk?
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: they&amp;#39;re kind of useful.
~wacrel-ripwes &amp;quot;Salo&amp;quot; is in the building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; has a fixation on reading boot routines from operating
systems - small steps loading bigger steps and eventually BAM, an OS happens.
~rovrel-bicmyl has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes we&amp;#39;re going to burn the old furniture, but
we&amp;#39;ll have new furniture
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: the old furniture is crawling with bedbugs and
scabies.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is not opposed to software, just the software we
have
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: but will you be replacing comfy recliners with
barstools?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is not opposed to government, just the
government we have
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] becomes ~hobmed-hinrym
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: comfy recliners crawling with bedbugs
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee] is in the building
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: hmm
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: people in the comfy recliners can still sit in
them
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; itches every time he has to reach in to the persistence
table - it&amp;#39;s a bottomless pit swarming with bees.
~rovrel-bicmyl is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: they have bedbugs anyway so who cares
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: initially the barstools are a little bit
uncomfortable
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: over time they grow backs and cushions, etc
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: i see.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you can&amp;#39;t go straight to the comfy recliner, it
is simply not doable from an engineering standpoint
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] has left the building
~wacrel-ripwes &amp;quot;Salo&amp;quot; has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but good metaphor btw...
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: tognex, where are you in Idaho, north or
south?
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: south, dondep
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] continues to think tognex should be a VC when he
grows up.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Why would you wish such a fate on someone, tasfyn? :)
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Aha. I have some friends in northern
Idaho, was wantingto see how small the world actually was. :)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] was in wyoming this summer for a VC sponsored
retreat, probably not too far away
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: oh please, I&amp;#39;m trying to sound smarter than I am :p
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: if anyone is interested in a &amp;quot;annotated chat&amp;quot; that shows
the rawish server messages as they come in
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: like everything, there are good ones and bad
ones
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: try :~wacrel-ripwes/main/cp1/bin/achat
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: hatteb, it&amp;#39;s more about the fate he&amp;#39;s
wishing on future software developers :)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has spent 40 years trying to sound smarter than
he is, it&amp;#39;s one of the core VC skills btw
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; always worries about sounding like a fool.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: are you planning on going to college early,
tognex, or waiting till the usual age?
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot; has left the building
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;ll go to college yet, tasfyn.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that&amp;#39;s an even better decision
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; was about to say, &amp;quot;are you planning on going to college
at all?&amp;quot;.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: I probably will. But I might just become a
bartender. You never know.
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot; is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: did your parents&amp;#39; ideology/religion take on
you, or have you rebelled against it?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: or a bit of both?
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: tasfyn, hey, some of us managed to do both
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: ha! their ideology and mine are miles away
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: heh yes
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] grew up in a communist/atheist family so he
never had that conflict
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: i&amp;#39;m rather good at hiding that, though :P
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] understands this but suggests tolerance, one day
it will make a little more sense to you
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: so, are /you/ trying to take over the world, or are
you trying to make /urbit/ take over the world
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: easily the worst experience i had growing up was
spending time at a bible camp...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: oh the latter, really
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I essentially want the world to take over
itself
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I really don&amp;#39;t enjoy ruling people or anything,
it&amp;#39;s an enormous pain in the butt
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: and yes, the world will become Tlon.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] might try to raise his kids as Christians,
despite not being one himself
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: so you&amp;#39;re just aiming for world optimization
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: except that his wife had to go to bible camp
and would never tolerate it
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: sure.  world optimization, that&amp;#39;s a fine term
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: nice job wacrel-ripwes
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: heh, don&amp;#39;t do that. raise them as good people.
that&amp;#39;s all you should do, in my opinion
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: if they want to follow an old, rather funky smelling
religion, that&amp;#39;s their personal choice
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has settled on sending them to Chinese school,
they get the fascist thing right
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: now define &amp;quot;good&amp;quot;.
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot; has left the building
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: thanks ~satnum-maptux... (wacrel-ripwes is up on DO so
it stays up all the time)
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; frantically gestures to indicate that this is merely a
thought exercise.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: basically the cause of the funky smell
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I have two machines that are up all the time
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: is that when you have anything that the best
people leave, the not-so-best will remain
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: One of them runs FreeBSD, I had a bad enough time last
time I tried running vere on it that I haven&amp;#39;t tried again
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: old things do not have to smell funky
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but they will inevitably smell funky if they
are populated only by mediocrities
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: no, they don&amp;#39;t
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: 32-bit freebsd, virtualized in kvm
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and all the cool people have left
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: when you look at American evangelical
Christianity
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: but some old things /do/ smell rather funky
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it has suffered this fate in the extreme
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: all of Christianity has suffered this fate -
basically all of the ancient world
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot; is in the building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: satnum, vere runs well enough on 9.1-amd64, and I
think I localized the bad performance to my config.
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: fancy... i just stick with stock Ubuntu
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we cannot help but observe its funkiness, which
is acutely obvious especially to the young and bright
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and of course, there is a silliness to any
ancient myth
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: the machine I have in front of me, and the machine
that runs novrud-hanweb, are real live ubuntu machines
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: on the other hand, there is a silliness to a
large number of modern myths
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: modern myths like Unix.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: christianity is such a wide border that there are
all kinds of things under it, funky, non-funky, extremely funky
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which do not smell funky, simply because the
best and brightest people believe in them
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: What sort of christianity are your parents into,
tognex?
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: unix is less of a myth, more of a
cautionary tale
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this is also true
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: not sure. tiny church
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot; has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it still can be classified on the Christian
equivalent of the Unix History Poster
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: fairly tolerant, or so they say, but mum complains
about the gays/etc and moral decline of society
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; is familiar with this type of branch. &amp;quot;Love the sinner
hate the sin&amp;quot;, for the gays?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: well, there&amp;#39;s moral decline and moral decline
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] knows some pretty moral gays
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; knows some pretty immoral hets.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: on the other hand, his 3-year-old son&amp;#39;s first
really coherent sentence was:
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]  is debugging a pretty immoral Python test
suite.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: &amp;quot;Pop, why do... dangerous persons [meaning San
Francisco&amp;#39;s indigenous zombies]... have shopping carts?&amp;quot;
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; thinks python test suites are amoral, not immoral...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I actually am familiar with all the stages of
moral decline
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;to trap little children like you inside, naturally&amp;quot;
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: hatteb, you haven&amp;#39;t seen this one
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: remember to traumatize your children, parents.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: first a young teenager runs away from his
intolerant Christian parents in, let&amp;#39;s say, Idaho
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: if you don&amp;#39;t leave the psychological scars, WHO
WILL?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: he comes to the Haight-Ashbury which is
basically where I live
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: (you have the right idea, tog.)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the weather is good here, you can live on the
street
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: buy weed by the ounce and sell it by the eight
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: have a little yellow dog on a leash, put out a
sign and ask for change
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s cool, it&amp;#39;s fun
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the future is full of possibility
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: all your life possessions are in a backpack
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s a big backpack and over time it gets a
little gnarly
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and time passes
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: time passes actually pretty fast when you&amp;#39;re
wasted all the time
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: (and people ask me why I don&amp;#39;t enjoy
visiting san francisco)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and after a few years your back doesn&amp;#39;t work
quite as well as it used to
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and you think:
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: gee, wouldn&amp;#39;t this be easier
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: if I had something I could roll?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and this is why dangerous persons have shopping
carts.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: (OTOH much of it has to do with how my car
got towed the first time I parked on the street.)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the basic problem is that there is no real
society for a bright young person to grow up into
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: eh, I don&amp;#39;t really think you should try to
psychologically scar your children
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: for example, in medieval Florence
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: everyone was a Christian
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: INSTEAD, you should try to teach them how to think
well.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: in fact a Catholic
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and if you were bright and talented in this
environment
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you could grow up and become incredibly learned
and also wealthy and successful, in fact you could be a cardinal
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: or even the Oope
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Pope
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: figure out things, learn for themselves, reason
well.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but there is no equivalent of this in American
tea party evangelical-Protestant churchy society
~rovrel-bicmyl has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] tends to feel that a child who can figure out
things, etc, will, and one who can&amp;#39;t won&amp;#39;t
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] doubts that it can be taught, unfortunately
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Reasoning well is a skill that gets
learned kind of late anyway
~rovrel-bicmyl is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but it certainly helps to be home-schooled with
the entire vastness of the internets on line
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: you have to equip them to do it, though
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: well, one thing that&amp;#39;s neat from my perspective
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; has left the building
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: there&amp;#39;s an ocean of facts to absorb before
there&amp;#39;s any need to do much reasoning about them.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: is that basically everything written before
1923 is on line
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so if you don&amp;#39;t like 2014 and you can read and
stuff
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Getting those organized right makes a
bigger difference than some people realize.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there&amp;#39;s really nothing stopping you,
intellectually, from growing up in 1914 instead
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: for example as I like to point out
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: although perhaps this should be on the %black
channel, but hey, it&amp;#39;s not loaded
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: no one cares
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that if you go to your google bar and type
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: &amp;quot;true history of the american revolution&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you get
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the true history of the american revolution
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: That _is_ a pretty fun little book.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: as explained by Sydney Fisher in 1903
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this history is not sold in stores
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is not taught in schools
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is not as seen on TV
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is not congenial to tea partiers
~sarlug-picwep &amp;quot;ikari&amp;quot; is in the building
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: you&amp;#39;re a black-banner, tasfyn?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is not congenial to progressives
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is not really congenial to anyone but
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it happens to be, in fact, true
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: well that explains some things, heh
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: tasfyn is the archaeologist who dug up the
black banner.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I am sort of the Karl Marx of the black banner
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it will probably take me some years to find my
Lenin
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Over the past 5 years people have started
noticing it a bit more.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but who knows, perhaps he&amp;#39;s in the room, heh
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the funny thing about that TechCrunch article
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: is that the people the author accuses of
sounding like me
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: without really any evidence whatsoever
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: are in fact two of our investors...
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: sigh, i don&amp;#39;t think anyone else is blue ;_;
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: blue banner is a lonely place
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s okay
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: i should have picked an interesting one instead of
an inoffensive one
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I actually would like to have some traffic on
the blue banner
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but it&amp;#39;s not happening yet
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: There&amp;#39;s benefits to being first :)
~sarlug-picwep &amp;quot;ikari&amp;quot; has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: part of the problem is that in real life
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: %blue and %red are actually the same thing
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but no one wants to admit this, so I am the
last to force it on people
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ideally we will expand past the %black ghetto
at some point
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: no, they&amp;#39;re two halves of the same thing that
constantly slap eachother and can&amp;#39;t get along for any reason
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: well, yes and no
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there is a lot of cartoon slapping
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but it&amp;#39;s basically friendly
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: for example, consider the word &amp;quot;progressive&amp;quot; -
does it mean %blue or %red?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] &amp;#39;s grandparents were longtime CPUSA members
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: i have no idea.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: exactly.  if you can
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: hell, I didn&amp;#39;t even know &amp;quot;progressives existed until
two weeks ago
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: if you can&amp;#39;t test whether two supposedly
categorically different things are different
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: they are not different
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: my grandparents never used the word &amp;quot;communist&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the euphemism was always &amp;quot;progressive&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: about as opaque as saran wrap
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but many young people who would call themselves
&amp;quot;progressive&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: have no knowledge of this history whatsoever
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: tasfyn, keep in mind you grew up in a
different country from tognex and I. (we have visited yours and see it on TV a
lot, of course :)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes that is true
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but my country is the real America
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is the ruling power
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which probably seems hard to remember at a
Texas high-school football game or whatever
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you always feel dominated by whatever is around
you
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is terribly irritating and oppressive to be
a young person cursed with a high IQ
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and find yourself surrounded by football
players, cheerleaders, Christian youth ministers, and the like
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you will find yourself going to the library and
finding copies of the New Yorker
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; shivers.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: tasfyn, why does urbit smell funky to me?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and secreting it under your bed, like a porn
magazine
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: what is funky about it?
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Primarily I&amp;#39;m referring to the fact that
&amp;#39;liberal&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;moderate&amp;#39; were the terms I always heard for both people favoring
and disfavoring th e category that is better covered by &amp;#39;progressive&amp;#39;

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: other than that it&amp;#39;s kind of new and broken
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; got in trouble in 5th grade for putting a computer book
inside the math textbook we were supposed to be reading.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: it feels like the design has oddities
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: and such
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it does have oddities
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but which ones?
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: The design does have oddities!
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: maybe it&amp;#39;s just new plastic smell
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there&amp;#39;s definitely some of that
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a lot of the OS level stuff kind of barely
works
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Most frequently, someone points out that &amp;quot;truth&amp;quot; is
&amp;quot;backwards&amp;quot;. My only response is to open a Unix shell and type
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: true; echo $?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: especially if you&amp;#39;re used to mature systems
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: mmm
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: 0=yes, 1=no may have been a mistake but it&amp;#39;s
too late now
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: yeah well
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: what still surprises me is that we&amp;#39;re chatting
away on top of this stack
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: it isn&amp;#39;t a mistake, from my perspective.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: there is nothing in hoon or arvo named
&amp;quot;creat&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: literally every character is interpreted in
Nock, at least logically
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: and yeah, that part is quite amazing.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Ken Thompson once was asked what he&amp;#39;d change if
he had to do Unix over again
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: heheh
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: dondep probably knows the answer...
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: well i&amp;#39;ve heard it two ways
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] only knows the &amp;quot;spell creat with two e&amp;#39;s&amp;quot; answer
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] osn
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] isn&amp;#39;t really sure why there&amp;#39;s a creat(), anyway,
he always just uses open() with O_CREAT
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: ok yes, that&amp;#39;s the actual one.
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee] has left the building
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: My other favorite truncated-name story is
about lisp
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] thinks tognex should skip college, learn to code
and come directly to San Francisco
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: rplaca! terpri!
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the beating heart of the technology world
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yeah, lisp goes crazy with ugly names
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Sussman and Steele were building a lispy
successor to PLANNER and CONNIVER
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: then they&amp;#39;ll have some ugly thing and want to
do it another ugly way, so they&amp;#39;ll put 2 on the end of the new method
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: and were going to call it SCHEMER
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: but ITS only allowed 6 character file
names so it was SCHEME
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] loves the block caps, they remind him of
McNamara and the Vietnam War
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: body counts on the IBM mainframes
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: yeah.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: at some point that&amp;#39;ll be hip again.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: well Charles Stross emulated the style
fairly well in his Laundry novels
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: CASE NIGHTMARE GREEN etc
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: i&amp;#39;m wondering what&amp;#39;ll happen if urbit destroyers all
get used
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: all 4 billion?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there aren&amp;#39;t 4 billion adult internet users on
the planet
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but the real answer is:
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the price will go up
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the thing is, when you have infinite identities
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: controlling spam is impossible
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: isn&amp;#39;t it 4-billion per cruiser? Or is that a
misconception I have?
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: and what happens when they become infeasibly priced?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: no, that&amp;#39;s a misconception you have
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: infeasibly as in?  my goal would be about $10
each
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but think about how much money you send your
ISP
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: okay.
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee] is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: also, a destroyer isn&amp;#39;t necessarily an
individual
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s a unit of reputation, really
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: okay, what does a higher-level ship (like a
destroyer) provide?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: one per family is probably more right than one
per person
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; avoids coining &amp;#39;reputron&amp;#39;.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: i mean, the only ones in here are destroyer users
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: :chat is restricted to destroyers, yes.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: hatteb, be serious, it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;reputoids&amp;quot;.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes, a cruiser or a carrier is really a piece
of network infrastructure
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: not for an individual at all
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it has to be essentially a benign hierarchy
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: or at least, that&amp;#39;s the design
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: weren&amp;#39;t they running out of ipv4 addresses?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ha.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: they did.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: sorta.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I use this example all the time
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: they are running out of ipv4 addresses to give
away for free
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: but ipv6 is a hot mess, and isn&amp;#39;t really that usable.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: then again, they sell entire blocks of them
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: at some point, they may have to actually resort
to capitalism
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; uses it anyway...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: imagine a world in which an ipv4 address was
your personal property
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: in this world, when you get an internet cell
phone
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you say, hey, here&amp;#39;s my PSTN number, here&amp;#39;s my
IP address
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and your IPv4 is proxied over IPv6, let&amp;#39;s say
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: (IPv6 works perfectly fine as an intranet)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and then, when you send mail, you don&amp;#39;t rely on
someone else&amp;#39;s relay
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: your mail comes from your own IPv4 address,
which is also your identity
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and if you spam from that address...
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: b-b-but you have to sign your mail with dkim!
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it goes on a blacklist and no more mail from
you, buddy, for the next six months
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: and dkim is hard, so you should pay
Google/Yahoo/Microsoft/AOL to deal with it!
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so you paid $10 for your IP address and now
it&amp;#39;s only worth $2
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hatteb sounds like he&amp;#39;s had to deal with this
problem personally
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; fehs at this racketeering glob.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but in any case, restricting the ability to
just create a new identity randomly
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: I did dkim the stupid way - turns out, nobody cares if
you use one private key to sign all of your domains.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: is the fundamental source of all social
behavior on the internets
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: E
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: bargh, our getopt string is approaching
an enumeration of the alphabet
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: ven the random domains i create for random purposes.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: infinite identity spaces are inherently
antisocial, which is why we need the facebooks of the world
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: heh, I&amp;#39;ve been making a bad assumption haven&amp;#39;t I?
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#39;t know. Have you?
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: urbit isn&amp;#39;t supposed to last /forever/, is it
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is definitely supposed to last forever
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: I am tempted to build some kind of long
options infrastructure
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: there are physics-based reasons to doubt
it will
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: Nothing lasts forever
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: well, sure.  in that sense.
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: but Urbit will probably last for a
while if we play our cards right
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but one day, tognex, you will be an old man
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you will still be tognex
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; thinks Urbit only needs to last as long as its
successors.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you will have amassed great reputation through
the wit and wisdom of tognex
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: tognex, the thing people don&amp;#39;t talk about
is that software systems always last longer than they are supposed to.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: on your deathbed your heirs will be gathered
around your bedside
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and one of them will get the house
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and another one will get tognex
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: assuming I die!
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: well, hopefully not
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you could be a futurist as well
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: i mean, from a non-optimistic standpoint, i probably
will
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: spoiler: we all die.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but if we conquer death, we&amp;#39;ll probably also
conquer infinite population growth
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: but hey, if i&amp;#39;m lucky, i won&amp;#39;t die for a very, very
long time
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and if not, there&amp;#39;s always the 64-bit ships
(yachts)
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: until nobody needs tognex anymore.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we all transcend internets and become
telepathic, or something
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I&amp;#39;m not so worried about that.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: urbit is definitely designed only for the human
race as we know it.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: for the human race and earth, that is?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and the model of real estate seems like a
pretty stable human universal.
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham] is in the building
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: not so much earth...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes.  you know, I grew up reading a lot of
science fiction, but actually it&amp;#39;s 2014 and I don&amp;#39;t seem to have a jetpack...
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: they exist, they&amp;#39;re just not that useful
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: real estate seems like a good metaphor
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] wouldn&amp;#39;t mind one of those magic pills that
would make him 15 again, though.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: I think I understand a little about deed
transfer
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: how will leases work?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: well, it depends what the purpose of them is
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: okay that&amp;#39;s sort of a vague question, yes.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: for quite the foreseeable future, destroyers
will be too cheap to lease
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: if the price per destroyer is even $100, that&amp;#39;s
a product you buy
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that would already make me one of the richest
men in human history
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so, at $1000, you start thinking about leasing
and stuff
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: A better way to put it might be: I want to
empower someone else to act on my behalf, for a specific purpose.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: at this point Urbit has a $4 trillion market
cap
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: In the world of assware, we use OAuth for
this.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ah, you&amp;#39;re still in the erights.org space :-)
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; makes the ward against OAuth.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: well, that&amp;#39;s a question I do know how to
answer there
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: basically my feeling is that the requirements
are still too vague
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: and in non-computer land, we have power of
attorney, hired agents, etc
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there may very well be a use for some sort of
agency model
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but it is difficult to generalize over
solutions without seeing examples
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Sure.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Fair enough.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and social mechanisms for these purposes are
often quite powerful
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a real security infrastructure is a combination
of social and technical mechanisms
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Sure.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: for instance, if Tlon is hosting dondep-radtud
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there is no technical way to prevent Tlon from
owning you
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Right.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but there is a very strong economic reason for
Tlon to protect your interests rather than violating them
~sarlug-picwep &amp;quot;ikari&amp;quot; is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: of course if we get a national security letter,
all bets are off
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; connects a logic analyser to the Tlon hardware, and
reads out zod&amp;#39;s keys.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Or a breakin, or a bad hire, etc etc
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but some people want to build things like
&amp;quot;homomorphic encryption&amp;quot; to in theory solve this technical problem
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: i wonder when urbit will have programs with color
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: color is nice
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: :-)
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: sure. So I guess the thing I don&amp;#39;t
understand about the model is: can Tlon host one of my yachts if the destroyer
is hosted elsewhere?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this will be done through webpages not through
pretty terminals
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: sure, the yacht is perfectly detachable
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: OK great, that goes a long way.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: actually it is only detached at the moment,
although the destroyer should be able to assume its identity
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; hopes the terminal does, one day, sprout xterm-256
support.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: without actually creating the ship
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: no pretty terminals? ;_;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] actually has never liked color in his terminals
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: maybe it&amp;#39;s because he grew up in the 80s
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: green screen, man
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: or amber
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that was cool
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: My first computer had a color monitor...
with a color/green/amber switch on the back.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: then in around 1992 I got this awesome
Cornerstone 1600x1200 grayscale monitor
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which needed its own graphics card and custom
Linux driver
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: tognex, making webpages look nice is
actually a ton easier than making stuff in a terminal look nice. It&amp;#39;s pretty
crazy.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] did a little bit of work on getting X to drive
that beast
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: my terminal is gray with white text.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is twelve tons easier.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; likes a splash of color, but not some clown-fruit
salad...
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: so, urbit stuff will be handled through webpages?
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: tognex, vere is already a webserver.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: eventually we&amp;#39;ll have a command prompt just
like this but in your broswer
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: (A friend of mine wrote a non-blocking
curses-alike in Python, so I&amp;#39;ve seen much of the elephant.)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] remembers when curses had a really hard problem
to solve, minimizing screen update cost
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: thought the goal was to make a complete everything,
OS, kernel, etc
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Yeah! Emacs still has a lot of that code
in it.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: I have _great_ nostalgia for curses-style interface.s
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes, but one thing at a time
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: but urbit is going to be based in conventional
browsers?
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: tognex, it&amp;#39;s not an OS in that sense at
the moment
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: if you solve the problem of a cloud server
first, you can eventually seep into the client
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: urbit is going to be accessible to web browsers, yes
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a cloud server can serve HTML/CSS/SVG/whatever
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: without directly mucking with the screen or
that nonsense
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] has left the building
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: ok
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: certainly not everyone wants a CLI, especially
when urbit starts to appeal to the less geeky
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but for now it&amp;#39;s quite adequate
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: yeah, but I&amp;#39;d like a non-browser non-cl interface
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: that&amp;#39;d be possible as well. Simple matter
of programming.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: i suppose that&amp;#39;s a tough thing to do, though.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I would too - but I have my business priorities
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Famous last words...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the thing is that it&amp;#39;s an enormous amount of
work to do, and more to drive adoption
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: but if the point of urbit is to get around the need
for use of things such as conventional internet technology, it seems a bit
weird to have it be p iggybacking off of it

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: whereas a &amp;quot;personal server&amp;quot; just isn&amp;#39;t that
hard to build
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: tognex, this is how networks are built
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the way I think of it is
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: tognex, it has to subsume conventional internet from
within.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: when people built the Internet
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there was already a network
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it was called the PSTN
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: public switched telephone network
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: tognex, i recommend watching this video,
it&amp;#39;s long but really interesting: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Z685OF-PS8
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: built by smart guys at Bell Labs in the 40s
through 60s
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: i suppose piggybacking off of things is a decent way
to get stuff done
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: If you&amp;#39;re ever in Seattle, there&amp;#39;s a museum of
telecommunications.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: provided great voice and even data circuits
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: excellent wires
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the Internet guys did not replace these wires
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: they ran packets on top of them
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but, Internet computers were totally isolated
from PSTN protocols like SS7
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: I hear that cable modems wrap a PPP session in an MPEG
transport stream.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] believes that.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so, tunneling the new over the old is a very
natural way to proceed
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: if the Internet had needed new wires, we
wouldn&amp;#39;t have an internet
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: hatteb, I am familiar with this form of
joke. you wait for someone to say &amp;quot;huh, really?&amp;quot; and you reply &amp;quot;SEE, YOU&amp;#39;RE NOT
SURE&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I could totally see wrapping a PPP session in
an MPEG transport stream
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; is actually somewhat serious. e read too much of the
spec a while back.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: did you know that your phone&amp;#39;s baseband
processor is still issuing Hayes modem commands?  ATDT and the like?
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; did!
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: well the original I heard was &amp;quot;the JVM
uses parts of the Mach kernel internally&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] remembers typing ATDT into a serial driver to
use the modem directly
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: well that&amp;#39;s just silly
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: sure. but still funny.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; remembers getting Ethernet drivers onto machine by
hooking them together with phone wires...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but PPP over MPEG is exactly the sort of thing
that telco heads would do.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ethernet isn&amp;#39;t as different from the phone as
we&amp;#39;ld like to imagine.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] remembers thin-wire Ethernet, which was
actually... oddly thick
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] remembers that he&amp;#39;s paying himself a salary and
actually tries to get some work done!
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: get a job, slacker!
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: heh, you have no idea what my wife went through
after my savings ran out, but before I got funding...
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; returns to a private hell of an undebuggable product
made entirely of race conditions and pain.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is going to transfer all his carriers to her,
just to show the world who&amp;#39;s responsible for this nonsense.
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; has left the building
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: so tasfyn, what do venture capitalists do?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: they listen to people like me and decide
whether to give them other peoples&amp;#39; money.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: they get people to invest their capital in new
ventures.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; likes using words to define themselves.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: not clear where the money comes from but it&amp;#39;s
generally old rich people.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: or pension funds or something.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: hey, so long as it&amp;#39;s %green.
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; is in the building
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: ah, so they try to get people to give people stuff.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so, essentially the job if you can get it, at
least at its best, revolves around applying common sense.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: or that&amp;#39;s the ideal anyway
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: here is a video of what it&amp;#39;s like at its worst:
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: eh, my laptop is too crappy to support videos
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zngK13FMgXM
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that&amp;#39;s awesome, save it for a real computer if
you can get to one
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; often has better luck with a tool to download the media
file, and a separate player app to actually play it. No browser involved.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] misses the spartan days of his early crappy
computers
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee] has left the building
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee] is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: when other people had the good sh*t and I
couldn&amp;#39;t afford it
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there was a certain style to that
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: The general concept is that they give 10
people a million dollars, expecting that 9 of them will fail and 1 will produce
something that ea rns them 100 million dollars.

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is the 1
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: just like in that movie with Keanu
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] actually used to look a lot like Keanu before he
got old and pudgy
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: I heard the original script had humans as paralell
processors in the matrix.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: I&amp;#39;m guessing you don&amp;#39;t mean _Much Ado
About Nothing_.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: It was changed to batteries because &amp;quot;nobody would
understand&amp;quot; humans as paralell processors.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: really? that might have been more sane
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] believes it.
~macmud-taprut: this was slightly before recaptcha started...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] remembers that Keanu did a Much Ado, although
nothing beats Point Break
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; just recently saw Bill &amp;amp; Ted&amp;#39;s.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: holy shit, that does make more sense
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I think I may have watched that one on acid in
the early 90s
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Much Ado, not Bill &amp;amp; Ted&amp;#39;s
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee] was going to say...
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; approaches acid cautiously. Never tried watching a
movie on it.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Bill &amp;amp; Ted&amp;#39;s would be a serious waste of good
acid
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Yeah, that&amp;#39;s more of a bonghit movie.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] recommends loading up on a couple of really
solid squares and putting this on the big screen:
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8om8-DnVTU
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it will literally destroy your soul - you&amp;#39;ll
feel much freer afterward
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; is currently forbidden from all grey-market chemistry,
unfortunately.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: alas, parenting and LSD don&amp;#39;t really mix.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Prescription 5HT2a agonists may interact badly with
psychonautic research.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: actually &amp;quot;Africa Addio&amp;quot; is pretty much intense
enough without any LSD.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] believes that.
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee] has a friend who watched Jacob&amp;#39;s Ladder
on acid
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: although I do think I tested it at one point
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: tasfyn, when will we be able to trade cat pictures
on urbit conveniently?
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: that&amp;#39;s right, a friend
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: nothing beats &amp;quot;Das Boot,&amp;quot; the director&amp;#39;s cut,
on the big screen, after two or three mushrooms
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the problem with cat pictures is that urbit
right now is a 32-bit virtual machine
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and for various silly reasons is limited to a
512MB address space
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and also, its network protocol gets about 20K a
second on a good day
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so cat pictures... you could do it right now.
if they were small.  but still it&amp;#39;s hard to encourage.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: You can send cat unicode.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: booooo
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: before urbit becomes accepted, we&amp;#39;ll need to be able
to send cat pictures.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that&amp;#39;s definitely true
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but you have to remember, we&amp;#39;re a cult
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a cult&amp;#39;s job is to be cool
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; has accepted Urbit&amp;#39;s nature as an evil,
mind-controlling cult run by a charismatic psychopath.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: not to get everyone in the world at the same
time
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: 
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: actually we only want the cool people
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: over time they will bring their uncool friends,
but gradually
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: if you only have the cool people, you don&amp;#39;t get the
support the uncool people provide
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: and adequately cool people can poke holes at cults
too well
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: eventually if we only take the cool peoples&amp;#39;
moneys, we can&amp;#39;t possibly have a business
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: why do you think most cults don&amp;#39;t have all the cool
people?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: well, there is &amp;quot;cult&amp;quot; in the sense of &amp;quot;cult
film&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: of course there are cults of uncool people as
well, but they don&amp;#39;t go anywhere
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: as for holes, we poke them ourselves first
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the difference between Urbit and Scientology:
Scientology can&amp;#39;t admit it&amp;#39;s a cult
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: also Scientology has a lot more money... and
Tom Cruise...&amp;#39;
~rovrel-bicmyl has left the building
~rovrel-bicmyl is in the building
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: well then we&amp;#39;ll just have to steal THEIR money!..
and Tom Cruise...
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: nah, not tom cruise
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] knows that Tom Cruise has only ONE FRONT TOOTH.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: if he fell for it, we don&amp;#39;t need tom cruise
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; likes Tom Cruise in the first Mission: Impossible film.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; also remembers the passcode to the Cray: AW96B6
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]:
https://www.google.com/search?q=tom+cruise+holoprosencephaly
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you all can ponder that while I write some
doc...
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee] has left the building
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: aahhhh, i don&amp;#39;t understand finite fields
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: stupid galois
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: well, they&amp;#39;re like infinite fields
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: but smaller
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee] is in the building
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: obviously
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: stupid djb making me learn math when i just
wanna do some crpyto
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: the worst part is that in about an hour i&amp;#39;ll
wonder at how simple all this is
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: and how i could have possibly been complaining
over something as stupid as a finite
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: field
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: If only Galois had practiced his
marksmanship more...!
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: for now though, i suffer
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: finite fields are beautiful
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: and I bashed my head against the wall
over them for like a week trying to figure out how they worked
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: a world in which galois and hamilton had won
their duels would be a much more interesting place
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; remembers that a field is just a set of numbers and an
operation...
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: well, operations
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Whoops.
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: well, and identities
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Right.
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: &amp;quot;Each finite field of size q is the splitting
field of the polynomial x^q − x, and thus the fixed field of the Frobenius
endomorphism which ta kes x to x^q.&amp;quot;

~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: wat
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: time to dive into the wikipedia hole
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Wikipedia is really bad at explaining a lot of this.
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: that makes a ton of sense after you&amp;#39;ve
spent a couple years studying abstract algebra, btw
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: iirc wolfram mathworld was a good
resource
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: as was this:
http://www.samiam.org/galois.html
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: i recall wikipedia being basically
useless to me
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: fortunately i think i have to learn the same
math for both ed25519 and aes
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham] spent the past several days trying to implement
ed25519 without understanding the math
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham] is kicking himself for wasting several days
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: I think the gist of a lot of the math in those papers
is &amp;quot;Hey mathematicians, these functions work on little-endian strings of bytes&amp;quot;
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; is in the building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;also you can productively use XOR on them&amp;quot;
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: i also have a hoon aes field multiply
somewhere if that&amp;#39;d be useful...
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Yuck, the Wikipedia page on finite fields is fairly
disgusting.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: A wall of proofs has never helped anyone.
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: hobmed, yes that&amp;#39;d be helpful
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: i&amp;#39;m bogged down in recursive definitions
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; is also interested, academically of course.
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: ~bilsym-bisner
/~hobmed-hinrym/try/2/bin/aes/hoon
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: &amp;quot;mur&amp;quot;, for speakers of languages that
fuck up ls and rs
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: thx
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: perhaps one of the key things to
unlearn is that multiplication is not just iterated addition
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: addition, being XOR, oscillates under
iteration
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: once you get the hang of the idea that
you&amp;#39;re operating on polynomials that just happen to have convenient numeric
representations, it should all start to come together

~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: are you clear on finite field addition?
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: not yet
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: the link you sent me was fairly clear, but i
still don&amp;#39;t understand, err, what exactly the field is
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: ok, so you&amp;#39;re adding polynomials of
degree n. for GF(2^8), degree 8. each polynomial has coefficients in GF(2).
since there&amp;#39;s only 2 of those, your result polynomial (of degree n) has each
coefficient looking like the two inputs XORed

~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; has left the building
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: only two possible things each
coefficient can be, that is
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: hey, Steve Dee read my patch, thanks!
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: sure thing
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: uh oh
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: wossup, insane cult?
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: that 59009 was not meant to make it into the final
commit
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; feels bad that his carrier PR did not include a useful
patch. %self-shame.
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: oh, I see now.
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: that was just a test value, before I figured out how
to make it a command-line arg
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: i&amp;#39;m about to buy &amp;gt;20000 dogecoin
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: to build a dogedice robot
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: fixed...
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: that&amp;#39;s ridiculous
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: that&amp;#39;s like less than $10
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: oh, true
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: gambling is wrong:)
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: sometimes i forget how worthless dogecoin is
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee] is working on a branch with lug_u ripped
out of u2_host
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: it boggles my mind that these machines crap out 0.1BTC
every week, and that&amp;#39;s a money making proposition
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: hey that history-eating bug IS fixed.  thanks for that
too steve!
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: word
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: :ought to pull up to the latest vere.
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: that fix has drastically improved my
quality of life, personally
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: i used to make my sentences shorter so that I didn&amp;#39;t
trigger the bug
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: yeah, a desirable side effect of that
bug
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Tmux is much happier with vere
now
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: ahhhh, this page is much better
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field_arithmetic
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: it enforced short chat lines
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: (desirable? well, I liked it that
way...)
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;enforced&amp;quot; in the &amp;quot;press enter before it&amp;#39;s too late&amp;quot;

~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee] occasionally catches himself typing
really fast to try to get his text in &amp;quot;before&amp;quot; the 80 character mark...
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: dogecoin is inspiring
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: speaking of mixed motor metaphors
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; &amp;#39;s partner&amp;#39;s parent asked if Dogecoin was &amp;#39;real.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: when people complain that it&amp;#39;s a dumb
joke, I point out that the global financial system is too
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: pretty much.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: What is a trillion dollars?
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Nigeria printed trillion-dollar bills once.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: as a friend put it, &amp;#39;dogecoin is the
&amp;quot;ironic trucker hat worn by an actual trucker&amp;quot; of cryptocurrency&amp;#39;
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: i am not sure what that means but I think it means I
better have some dogecoin
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: ooh, instead of the history-eating bug,
we now have an unhistory-vomiting bug if you backspace over a long line
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: or rather if you move the cursor back
over a long line...
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee] still calls that progress
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; has left the building
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Only the first full line of text is duplicated, though
it is duplicated for every character over which one back-cursors.
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: alright, i&amp;#39;m going to give vere a shot on my freebsd
machine again
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; makes the sign of the PR in yebyen&amp;#39;s direction
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: have a feeling here goes my website
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: huh, I only see it once
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: Segmentation fault: 11 (core dumped)
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: also took bind and node with it, but not apache
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: impressive...
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: portmaster also continued without interruption
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: i&amp;#39;ll set up a machine that doesn&amp;#39;t also run my website
to reproduce this bug on it
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Now that I have the line-eating bugfix, I find myself
unable to fill the window. Bleah!
~rovrel-bicmyl  has the best hearing-about-urbit story but prefers remaining
all mysterious.
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]:  Darn your mysterious attraction
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot; will teach you a new word if you share your story.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; prefers remaining mysterious, but will allow that e
heard of urbit through a friend on IRC, who saw it being neglected on Hacker
News.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: i heard about it from a friend on irc
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: who wanted to show me how loony the documentation
was
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: and i ended up installing it, for the entertainment
value
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee] heard about it while fucking off on
/r/programming on break time at the monastery
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: it&amp;#39;s a lot cooler now that you don&amp;#39;t have to go on the
mailing list and ask why chat is down
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: so are there any programs other than :chat
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: that are noteworthy
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: :game
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: ls and cat are pretty important
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: i was going to say game next
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: there&amp;#39;s also pope
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: :ticket, for issueing yachts from your Destroyer.
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: hi and ye
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: there&amp;#39;s :thumb
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: there&amp;#39;s :type
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: :zero, to remind you of the Carrier identities.
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; hadn&amp;#39;t seen that one
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: there&amp;#39;s :~novrud-hanweb/try=/bin/chat
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: which takes you to the other chat room
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: and then of course there&amp;#39;s :room, which actually
handles the stateful chat room thing
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: are there secret conspiracies in there?
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: it do
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: hmm?
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: there be
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;they think it don&amp;#39;t be like it is but it do&amp;quot;
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: so what is the other chat room exactly
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: its just a proof of concept
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: there&amp;#39;s only one chat, for all intents and purposes
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: because chat is written to use sein who to see what
ship should be running the room server
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: ~doznec~
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: but there&amp;#39;s no reason you couldn&amp;#39;t use a different
heuristic, or a hard-coded value
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: oh,  ok
~sarlug-picwep &amp;quot;ikari&amp;quot; has left the building
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: damn i was hoping for another layer of conspiracy
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: there are a few other differences to make sure you can
use both chats without going crazy or getting confused
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: it&amp;#39;s actually where I keep my hitler jokes since
hitler jokes don&amp;#39;t really fit under a banner :)
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: other than banners. i am the only blue it seems ;_;
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; has to follow up with real hitler jokes now
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: oops i missed you sarlug-picwep
~sarlug-picwep &amp;quot;ikari&amp;quot; is in the building
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: there we go!  20791.75DOGE
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has left the building
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] is in the building
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: am i the only blue-banner? ;_;
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I am red, there are very few of us too
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I don&amp;#39;t use the banner much, since there&amp;#39;s no banner=
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: or is there...
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Do you know of the :thumb procedure, ~tognex?
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: nope...
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: satnum-maptux/try=&amp;gt; :thumb ~tognex-labmeb
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: [%duke p=[%punk p=%blue q=&amp;#39;Tiktalik&amp;#39;]]
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: you need to be neighbors first
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: or you get ~
/a/~tognex-labmeb/will/~2014.1.15..21.52.20..dbab
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Neighborship can be accomplished either via :hi~$shipname
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: (which is done at the terminal)
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: or by sending a private :chat message, e.g. ~$shipname
&amp;lt;message&amp;gt;
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: ah
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: neighborship is the equivalent of friending someone?
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: won&amp;#39;t you be. my neighbor.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: No, it is impermanent.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: ah
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: It must be re-established if either party exits the
Urbit network.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: You and are are neighbors currently.
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: you mean if your address changes?
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: i didn&amp;#39;t think that was the case
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: No, just if you logoff
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: ah
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: when you shut down your pier.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: oh, so it&amp;#39;s a direct connection?
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Correct
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: A direct, encrypted connection.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: I suspect the :room server to retain a copy of private
:chat messages,
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: but :hi ~$ship_name &amp;quot;&amp;lt;message&amp;gt;&amp;quot; are secret
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: ok
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: speaking of, it&amp;#39;s shutting down my pier time now
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Vale, dear ~satnum.
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; is in the building
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: hello novrud
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; has left the building
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; is very apprehensive about missing messages between

~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: :)
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: heh
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] has left the building
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; is in the building
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: so what should i do with my other destroyer
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: try not to sink it
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Create a new pier, and :begin it from there.
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; has left the building
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Imbue it with a different facet of your persona.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Pick your true banner
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: or the one on which you most wish to spy.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: But I don&amp;#39;t know what my true banner is!
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Then pick the most interesting one.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Or %white.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: %white is boring
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: But as a practical matter, the advantage of %white is to
signal formal non-alignment.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: what would you say the most interesting one is?
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: %black has the most chatter, hands down.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: %blue&amp;#39;s probably the least active
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: I am orthogonal to all banners; I am an
arch-experimentalist.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: so what are you spying on?
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: To spy is nigh malicious - I surveil.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: The people behind the shadowy cult, of course.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Who watches the watchers? The meta-watchers of unlimited
abstraction.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: ...who are you surveiling?
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: You.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: hatteb, what&amp;#39;s the most interesting banner
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: CYG
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: 
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: heh
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: hell, what are the banners, i&amp;#39;m not even sure i
understand them entirely
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: banners are defined by ++sect
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: and inspired by the Qing dynasty, or so i hear.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: They are an admission of the tribal nature of much of
humanity, and a place to channel political expression that would otherwise
disrupt public affairs.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: mhmm. and what do they represent?
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Broadstroke political persuasions.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; suggests tognex read the doc for :begin more carefully
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Start up your other Destroyer and compare the banner
options.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: yeah, that&amp;#39;s a good idea.
~bishus-namsum &amp;quot;ayanami&amp;quot; is in the building
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: feck, I just noticed ++tube

~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Urbit is a series of tubes
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: atax1a is the lucky dog who got ~net
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: but Stephenson fans know the real Metaverse lives on the~ret
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; liked it because 79 is one less than the web
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: and it&amp;#39;s where you stick your fingers.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: also net is a jerkcity character.
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: We shall see how mine susses out
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: One less? 79=net, 80=sec, 81=mul, 82=nym, 83=tev,
84=web.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; means the oldweb.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Ah, port.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Copy.
~bitmet-racteg &amp;quot;IMT&amp;quot; is in the building
~bitmet-racteg &amp;quot;IMT&amp;quot;  once knew a fellow who possessed a white US passport.  I
was told this meant that he was stateless and a refugee, and had some kind of
permanent non-citi zen residency status in the US.  The former Vietnam was his
country, and so he was stateless.

~bitmet-racteg &amp;quot;IMT&amp;quot;: I wonder if Curtis might not know something about this?
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Intriguing.
~bitmet-racteg &amp;quot;IMT&amp;quot;  resolves to get back to work.
~bitmet-racteg &amp;quot;IMT&amp;quot;  mundane, paying work.

~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Oh. and I understood yesterday why Nock is
named Nock.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: A re-entry passport for permanent residents who cannot
acquire a passport from their nation of origin.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Though it is now green, not white.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: What is that reason, dash?
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; has its suspicions, itself.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: It&amp;#39;s a rewriting system based on immutable
trees, and is thus an enemy of state.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#39;t follow the reasoning from there to Nock.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: I thought it was something to do with mockingbirds. :)
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: oh, in the Smullyan sense
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: look up &amp;quot;Our Enemy The State&amp;quot;

~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: uh yeah, i haven&amp;#39;t eaten since breakfast.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: should do something about that.
~tognex-labmeb &amp;quot;Tiktalik&amp;quot;: yes, not eating is bad for you

~monder-navryx &amp;quot;LarryH&amp;quot;: anything else i can try to get things resolved?
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: I&amp;#39;ve heard a couple of people mention this issue, but I
don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;ve experienced it myself. What are the symptoms?
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; has left the building
~monder-navryx &amp;quot;LarryH&amp;quot;: i&amp;#39;ve edited a file and the old contents are what&amp;#39;s

~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Did you modified the file while vere was running?
~monder-navryx &amp;quot;LarryH&amp;quot;: i&amp;#39;ve seen this before but restarting vere usually
fixed it
~monder-navryx &amp;quot;LarryH&amp;quot;: yes, modified while it is running
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Does it also not update to record adding/removing a
file?
~monder-navryx &amp;quot;LarryH&amp;quot;: in the past, i would get a line saying the change was
noticed, now nothing
~monder-navryx &amp;quot;LarryH&amp;quot;: even did a make clean and full make but no difference

~monder-navryx &amp;quot;LarryH&amp;quot;: don&amp;#39;t have to quit chat that way :)
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: I fear I can not recommend a remedy, but Tlon would most
likely be interested to hear your bug report.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: I would try to reproduce the behavior though, either
with a submarine on you linux box, or Destroyer on your mac.

~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: A fine idea. What happens if you try to access the

~monder-navryx &amp;quot;LarryH&amp;quot;: strangely enough, :cat shows the previous contents

~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: E.g. :~monder-navryx/try=/3/bin/foo
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: No re-synchronization at all then.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Have you tried building a new pier?
~monder-navryx &amp;quot;LarryH&amp;quot;: not yet, this just started a day or so ago
~monder-navryx &amp;quot;LarryH&amp;quot;: was just about to build a new sub but thought i&amp;#39;d make
inquiries first
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: There&amp;#39;s also :reboot.
~monder-navryx &amp;quot;LarryH&amp;quot;: yeah, tried that too, its like something has gotten

~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: That behavior does sound pretty
interesting.
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: I had that problem on Arch for a
while... turned out I didn&amp;#39;t have URBIT_HOME set
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: so, do you have URBIT_HOME set?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has left the building
~monder-navryx &amp;quot;LarryH&amp;quot;: ah, it appears that i don&amp;#39;t
~monder-navryx &amp;quot;LarryH&amp;quot;: man, all that hair pulling and you come along with
such a simple fix
~monder-navryx &amp;quot;LarryH&amp;quot;: changes immediately noticed when i started vere up
again
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: yeah, tell me about it. I was a little
crestfallen when I figured that out on Arch after a time of excitedly digging
into libuv&amp;#39;s fs ev ents API.

~monder-navryx &amp;quot;LarryH&amp;quot;: just got things re-installed on my new machine and the
environment settings got over looked
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: *nod*
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: we could probably make a way better
guess at URBIT_HOME than we do if it weren&amp;#39;t set
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is in the building
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: but I&amp;#39;m glad that we don&amp;#39;t, because it
makes it really obvious that you don&amp;#39;t have URBIT_HOME set
~monder-navryx &amp;quot;LarryH&amp;quot;: yeah, there&amp;#39;s always that
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has left the building
~monder-navryx &amp;quot;LarryH&amp;quot;: thanks a heap for the assist, ~hobmed-hinrym
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: sure thing! :)

~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;  is trying to learn nock
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: When dealing with the slot operator, it is often useful
to draw the entire binary tree, of which the list only explicitly encodes the
outermost nodes.
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: i get how it works, i just can&amp;#39;t work through it
step by step
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: i tried to do /[6 [97 2] [1 42 0]] 
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: What rule then applies?
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: line 19, 6 = 3 + 3, so that&amp;#39;s /[2 /[3 [97 2] [1 42
0]]], right?
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: and then i do the /[3 [97 2] [1 42 0]]
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: which gives [1 42 0]
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: so that&amp;#39;s /[2 [1 42 0]], which i can&amp;#39;t do anything
with
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: I think you have the groupings wrong.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: /[6 b]
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: /[2 /[3 b]]
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: /[2 /[3 [97 2] [1 42 0]]]
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: No, that&amp;#39;s right.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Hm
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: right, and i can&amp;#39;t directly resolve the 2 because
there&amp;#39;s still the / in there
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: so i do /[3 [97 2] [1 42 0]]
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: which gives [1 42 0] by line 18
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: plug that back in and it&amp;#39;s /[2 [1 42 0]], which
doesn&amp;#39;t match any of the rules but 19
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: try 19, /[2 /[a b]], where a = 1 and b = [1 42 0],
that gives /[2 /[1 [1 42 0]]], resolve /[1 [1 42 0]] to get [1 42 0] and...
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: ...i&amp;#39;m back where i was with /[2 [1 42 0]]
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: [1 42 0] =&amp;gt; [1 [42 0]]
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: /[2 [1 [42 0]]] =&amp;gt; 1
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: ah
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: right, /[2 [1 42 0]] = /[2 [1 [42 0]]] = /[2 1 42 0]
= /[2 1 [42 0]], they&amp;#39;re all equivalent
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: so i have to adjust the brackets until i get the
last one
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: well i don&amp;#39;t have to but it&amp;#39;s easiest for human
pattern-matching
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Yes, the spec tries to avoid parenthis overload by

~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Potential semistupid questions
for my own minimal enlightenment and hopefully general meat for discussion by
those more qualified : What type of binary tree is Nock? Is it an algebraic
expression tree? How is it traversed? Might this be easier if I drew the tree
and calculated manually instead of looking a t numbers until my eyes bleed?
(Once more my lack of symbolic logic is apparent.)

~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: And will the wiki including such
things as https://github.com/urbit/urbit/wiki/Decoding-Hoon be updated in
accordance with the la st few months of doc/etc updates?

~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: hm, never heard the term &amp;quot;algebraic
expression tree&amp;quot;
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: looking at the wikipedia page i would say
no it isn&amp;#39;t
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: since their example has arithmetic
operation tokens in them
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Boolean? Or something else
entirely?
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: it&amp;#39;s a tree of atoms and cells
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I&amp;#39;m well accustomed by now to
hearing that Urbit is &amp;quot;X, but not as we know it&amp;quot;
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Most of the time, I never knew X
to begin with
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: it&amp;#39;s pretty much like conses in lisp
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: conses in lisp are a pair of values, where
values are either conses or atoms
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: same in nock, a noun is an atom (number)
or cell containing a pair of nouns
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I basically have nothing in my
experience or knowledge base to model any of this on, apart from reducing
formulas long ago and fa r away in entry level algebra, which is where I hit a
number of walls

~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: So I&amp;#39;m mainly an observer
tinkering at the OS level, while in my copious free time indulging myself in
the tantalizing, frustrati ng deeper mysteries

~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: right, well. this is indeed one of those
earth-programmer concepts that urbit builds on, that doesn&amp;#39;t have a direct
equivalent in algebra or whatever

~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I keep telling my wife to try it
as she is reasonably well learned in math as well as having a more intuitive
grasp of abstract/e ngineering-type thought.

~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: And she loves puzzles.
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: It should be a shoe-in
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: it&amp;#39;s _sort of_ like those algebraic
expression trees, in that nock operations are encoded as numbers
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: but they&amp;#39;re encoded in a different order
from the example on wikipedia
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; is in the building
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I can see in the abstract how a
given integer can have a meaning as an operation
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Where I fail to make the jump is
making the calculation - I know functional programming at the level of an Excel
spreadsheet, to use the oft-quoted example, but it&amp;#39;s still vague on how things
are &amp;quot;done&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s like Zen programming compared to the common-sense-makes-sense
imperative style. &amp;quot;Let go of comman ds, describe reality, and what you want to
happen, will happen.&amp;quot;

~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: well there are only 10 of them to look at
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: yeah I don&amp;#39;t have a real firm grasp on
zeno&amp;#39;s execution model myself
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: That does indeed simplify matters
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: one of them is increment, and it has the same
structure as the rest
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: relative to the idea of subject and formula
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: but yeah, nock is a function that takes a
noun and returns a new one
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: the logical operators on 8 through 14 are all &amp;quot;not
cells&amp;quot;
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: i&amp;#39;m at urbit-is-easy ch2
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]  wants to write some Hoon documentation in
the form of a historical/archeological essay
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I thought one of these numbers meant increment but...
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: it looks like it actually means &amp;quot;increment nock cell&amp;quot;
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: *[a 4 b]
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: and &amp;quot;stateless&amp;quot; means no state is
maintained between operations? Which is even more mysterious to me than a basic
stack machine ( I watched a dummies-level video on that +accumulators). And I
think I vaguely get how a monad can carry information from one operation to the
next, without state, but...

~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: where [a b] describes a cell to be nocked and
incremented
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: well, &amp;quot;state&amp;quot; just means &amp;quot;something that
affects the operation that isn&amp;#39;t represented in its inputs&amp;quot;
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: to be honest I am still stuck at nock 8, out of nock
6-10 it&amp;#39;s the only one I understand
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: the rest I could probably get if I tried, but I&amp;#39;ve
only &amp;quot;read and understood&amp;quot; at the same time nock 8
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: and then by extension I guess also 7
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: so nock is stateless because all the
information that affects its operation is represented in the noun
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: I did work out what 9 is for, but he then
explains it in chapter 4, so :)
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I didn&amp;#39;t work out 8, I read the explanation and
followed it
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: well, I worked it out by readig the explanation
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Yeah, I lack ninja (or really any
more than simpleton) skills in not just math, but symbolic logic *and* learning
other languages in general, computer or human...any one of which I suspect
would be a strong advantage in the whole idea of &amp;quot;thinking different&amp;quot; that has
to be done to truly understand and exp ress oneself in a language.

~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Hence why I keep pimping Urbit to
everyone I can
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: well, hoon/nock aren&amp;#39;t extremely
foundationally different from other programming stuff. they just don&amp;#39;t follow
the fashions/conventions of the past few decades

~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I figure if some non-computer
person with one or more of the above skills figures it out, they&amp;#39;ll at least be
able to help me und erstand it at a kiddy level, which would be more than my
current level

~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: there is a really small number of programs to
understand at this point
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I also suspect my wife might be
that person, if only I could pry her away from Pokemon and other sinister
competing worlds
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: it seems like there are enough to work up to
understanding arvo
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Heh, I famously attempted
deciphering &amp;quot;hello world&amp;quot; in Hoon
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: but having not seen anyone claim to have done that,
other than the author
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: it remains to be seen
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: It did not go well
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: no, you need to start with nock, I&amp;#39;m convinced of that
:)
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Apparently so
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I still don&amp;#39;t know what a core is, but I&amp;#39;m one step
closer after understanding nock 8
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: We fear numbers
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Unfortunately I recognize that as
one of my greatest flaws, for many reasons, but most importantly because &amp;quot;math
is how you know you&amp;#39;re being lied to&amp;quot;

~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: yeah, we need math
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: well, fortunately nock and friends are
almost entirely unrelated to math
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: you need math for crypto, certainly... :)
but that goes on top
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: a core is basically nock&amp;#39;s mechanism for
self-reference
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Yeah, I still need Nock Like I&amp;#39;m
Five
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: which cgy said his offspring
might be ready to write when they&amp;#39;re Eight
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]:  So according to the wiki page,
which binary tree is Nock most like? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: Nock is just a function
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: It is not a tree, the nock expression is a tree where
the root is blank until it&amp;#39;s been evaluated
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: then when it&amp;#39;s evaluated, you have a different tree
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: possibly just one atom
~roppec-sampyx &amp;quot;Lysergic Spooner&amp;quot; has left the building
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: nock is evaluated on cells
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: nock atom is an error, that&amp;#39;s one of the first lessons
~roppec-sampyx &amp;quot;Lysergic Spooner&amp;quot; is in the building
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: and a cell is a binary tree with at least two atoms on
opposite sides
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: but a cell like this... [4 [5 6]]
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: has one atom on the left and two atoms (another cell)
on the right
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: and may or may not be valid nock
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I suspect it&amp;#39;s not, since I just threw it together and
I don&amp;#39;t know nock :)
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: at least not well enough to just &amp;quot;write some nock&amp;quot;
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Might it help at all to refresh
my memory on how to reduce formulas in algebra?
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]:  My guess is no
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: the only way they&amp;#39;re similar is that
they&amp;#39;re both doing some kind of reduction
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: nah, you&amp;#39;re not doing any algera at all in nock
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: the actual reduction steps are different
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: if you can grasp the idea of turning &amp;quot;(1 +
(3 * 2))&amp;quot; into &amp;quot;7&amp;quot; then that&amp;#39;s all the algebra you need to know :)
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I can see that
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: and even that is misleading because you
reduce arithmetic from the innermost parens first
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: whereas nock is top-down
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: &amp;quot;top-down&amp;quot; only reinforces this
notion I have of the integers themselves arranged in a tree, and that that is
somehow used as a tool
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; has the same notion.
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: all of the pictures of binary trees I see on this wiki
page are not good examples of nocks
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: because they have integers at the root of cells
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: the cell is the root of the cell
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: the integer (or its cell children) are the - and the +
of the cell&amp;#39;s tree, left and right
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: So is this Nock?  1 splits to 2
3, 2 splits to 4 5, 3 splits to 6 7...and what happens when you run out of
integers?
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: so, numbers are only leaf nodes, not internal nodes 
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: oh you&amp;#39;re talking about addressing
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: the cell address does not have a number at it, it has
an cell at it
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: that should be clear right
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Ugh, trying to figure out how to
phrase next question
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: yebyen taht&amp;#39;s not strictly accurate afaik,
address 1 is root of the tree
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] is in the building
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: yes, and if the tree is a cell then address 1 is a
cell, not an atom
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: if it&amp;#39;s not a cell, then 1 is an atom and has no
leaves
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Let&amp;#39;s try this: If I type in
numbers to be interpreted as Nock formulas, how does it know whether they&amp;#39;re
values or pointers to l ocations in the tree?

~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: they are part of either a subject or a formula, if
they&amp;#39;re well formed nock
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: So I have this drawing, and it
ends with 4 splitting into 8 and 9, at the left
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: yeah that&amp;#39;s just addresses, they&amp;#39;re only
used by operator 0
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: those are the right locations for 4, 8, and 9
~rovrel-bicmyl is in the building
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: so if you said [a 0 9], and a was the tree you have
drawn
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: you&amp;#39;d get back the value at location 9
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Okay, so: If I provide, say, five
integers. Will they be placed respectively in the matching cells (i.e., first
integer goes in &amp;quot; 1&amp;quot;, the top of the tree)? No, that can&amp;#39;t be right, because I
recall it was mentioned that the tree evaluates and ends with a result in the
top (previously empty) cell. But would n&amp;#39;t that be bottom-up?

~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I wasn&amp;#39;t going to say &amp;quot;assuming you ran nock on [a 0
9]&amp;quot; because I thought it was pedantic
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: if you have a tree, 1 is not an integer or atom
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: *if you have a cell/tree
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: this is the tree I imagine you have drawn, based just
on what you told me
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: [[[8 9] 5] 6 7]
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I think...
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: or [[[8 9] 5] [6 7]]
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: 1, 2, 3, and 4 being cells
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: tell me what each of those cells are...
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: starting with 4
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: [8 9]
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: since that&amp;#39;s easy
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: ...Nope, hitting the wall again
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: well after 4, the next easiest is 2
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: [[8 9] 5]
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: English and BASIC respectively
corrupted me too young
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: and under address 3..
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: [6 7]
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: putting it back together
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: [[[8 9] 5] [6 7]]
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: which is the same as [[[8 9] 5] 6 7]
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I know this doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense, sorry :)
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: That&amp;#39;s okay
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: It should be good for someone
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Hopefully more than one someones
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: each of the atoms I put into the cell are their own
address
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I have this recorded for
posterity to survive the breach, and to pass on to others
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: each of the missing numbers is the address of a cell
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: (why there is no atom representing that address,
because a cell is at that location)
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: it should be obvious that there&amp;#39;s not much sense
putting the address of the atom into the atom itself
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: since the atom can only store one value
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Okay, those last two lines almost
made sense, kind of
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: there might be some case where you want an atom to
tell you its own location, but I can&amp;#39;t imagine it now
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: good!
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: the binary tree structure in nock isn&amp;#39;t as
complicated as it looks
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i think of it as having layers
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: like pascal&amp;#39;s triangle
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: so layer 1 is 1
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: then 2:    2    3
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: then 3   4  5  6  7
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: then 4: 8 9 etc. etc.
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: That&amp;#39;s what I got
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I&amp;#39;m just hazy on how you figure
out what to plug in where - I think, more so than the next step of evaluating
the resulting expressin
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: now imagine each layer as a depth
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: in your nock expression
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: e.g. let&amp;#39;s take the atom 5
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: it has no depth
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: the cell [5 6] has a depth of 1
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: woah
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: sorry, internet cut out momentarily
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: so as i was saying
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: an atom has depth 0
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: a cell has depth 1
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: a nested cell like [5 [6 7]] has a depth of 2
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: (And a cell is always a pair?)
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: a doubly nested cell has a depth of 3 e.g. [5 [6
[14 15]]
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: yes
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: always
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: a cell is always a pair of nouns
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: but each element of that pair can be either an
atom or another cell 
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Okay, I think I just saw how the
first three lines of the spec give the ability to recursively define/declare
things. Possibly.
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: so the addressing structure is a little like a
lookup table
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: you find the depth of the element you want and
then count over
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: so let&amp;#39;s say i have the noun [[4 5] [6 [14 15]]]
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: which conveniently has all its values set to its
/ addresses
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: to find the address for 4 i would notice that
four is in my tree at a depth of 2
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: (i.e. its in a cell that&amp;#39;s within a cell)
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: so i count down two layers in my tree
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]:         1
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]:     2       3
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]:   4   5    6  7
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and then i count across
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: so 4 is 4
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: 5 is 5
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: 6 is 6
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and 7 is [14 15]
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: but there&amp;#39;s a simple rule that means i really
don&amp;#39;t have to keep this table memorized
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: which is that whenever you replace an atom with
a cell
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: so lets say i replace 4 with [8 9]
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: the address of the head of that cell is twice
the address of the cell itself (or the atom that you replaced)
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and the tail just has the address of the head
plus one
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: the head of any node n in your tree is always at
2n
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and the tail is always 2n+1
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Heh, at &amp;quot;simple rule&amp;quot; I was going
&amp;quot;Wait, no! That *was* simple...&amp;quot;
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Nope, that lost me again
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: But carry on, this is fascinating
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; is in the building
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: so you can see as you travel down the left side of the
tree
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: well think about it as pushing deeper into the
tree
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: the leftmost address is always 2^depth
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: 1 2 4 ...
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: holds for the top address too, which is 2^0=1
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: tomsyt, i have some arvo questions when
y&amp;#39;all are done here :)
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: k, my arvo knowledge is nicht sehr gut
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: At your leisure, I need to start
getting ready to head out to lunch
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i&amp;#39;ll conclude with this then
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: mainly curious about paths at the moment,
what do cy and cx signify?
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: you start out with a noun, let&amp;#39;s say its [[[8 9]
[10 11]] [6 [14 15]]]
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: that&amp;#39;s at layer 0
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and at /1
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: you push deeper
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: you can go into either the head or the tail
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: if you pick the head you get [[8 9] [10 11]]
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and now you&amp;#39;re at /2
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: which is twice where you were before
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: now you&amp;#39;re at /2, you can go into the head or
the tail
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: let&amp;#39;s say tail
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: which is [10 11]
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: or /5
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: which is two times /2 + 1
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: or 2n+1
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: basically, the 2n, 2n+1 rule is just like a game
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: where you start at /1 and navigate to whatever
part of the tree you&amp;#39;re looking for
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Precisely why I think my wife
will figure it out quickly
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: that&amp;#39;s just addressing though :)
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: .^(%cx path)  appears to get the contens of a file as
an atom.
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: there are 10 more things to get and only five of them
are obvious
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: %cy is something i&amp;#39;m not sure of yet.
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: where does %cy appear again?
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: As I said, I think that&amp;#39;s where
the majority of my issue lies, but we&amp;#39;ll see. Thank you all kindly, and I&amp;#39;ll
see you later this e vening.

~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: cheers!
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i think that just might be the path iirc
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and %cx is the data at the path
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] has left the building
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Huh. Not sure what that means exactly.
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: hang on, let me play with it
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: ok hoon question then
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: cy appears in ls and batz and in hume.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: yes.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: I&amp;#39;m looking at ++roil
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; has left the building
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: .^(%cy /~tomsyt-balsen
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: whoops
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: yes, meaning of .^ was my next question.
:)
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; is in the building
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: yes, %cx is the gigantic atom at the path
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and %cy is the path itself
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: okay. that conveys some kind of meaning to
this code :)
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: .^ is the &amp;quot;grab data from the sky&amp;quot; operator
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: ok. so that takes an access mode (%cy or
%cx) and a path and gives you some data
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; has left the building
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: %cy gives you the path itself, and %cx
gives you the data it refers to?
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: %cx definitely gives you the data
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i&amp;#39;m less confident about %cy
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: right. the obvious follow up is what&amp;#39;s
&amp;#39;hard&amp;#39; do
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: it&amp;#39;s listed in hoon.hoon under &amp;#39;almost
macros&amp;#39;
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: which makes me nervous
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: ++  hard?
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: it resists analysis with :type etc
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: hmmm, what does $+ do...
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: haven&amp;#39;t a clue, it&amp;#39;s not in ++  twig
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: which means it&amp;#39;s a tile
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and i have to confess that i still do not
understand tiles
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: curtis just put up chapter 9 though
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]:
http://www.urbit.org/2013/11/18/urbit-is-easy-ch9.html
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: well i should say: asking :type about what
(hard ...) produces gives me a core wrapped around my entire shell state
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: which covers this very topic
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: which makes me want to say &amp;quot;monadic
something something&amp;quot;
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: yes i did read that, it helped :)
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: please, we only use gonads out here
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: i did notice that&amp;#39;s not in the docs
anymore...
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: saner heads may or may not have prevailed
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: it doesn&amp;#39;t help that I read a bunch of
stuff from a few naming revisions ago
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: when twigs were genes etc =/
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: sane is relative, of course
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: yeah gen164 is a different beast from 191
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: okay more generic question then
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: given a core, what&amp;#39;s the nice way to see
the names of its arms
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: uhhh, +&amp;gt;?
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: Hm.
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i mean, you should be able to navigate around
any noun with hep lus and gal gar
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: which mean the same thing in this context
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: - and &amp;lt; both mean head
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and + and &amp;gt; both mean tail
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: the overloading is for legibility
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: so you have to say e.g.
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: -&amp;gt;+&amp;gt;
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: not -++-
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]  tries to fit an |% invocation on one line
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: or actually no that would be -+++
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: digging around in cores from the shell is
tricky, because half the time you hang the interpreter, the other half you get
giant walls of Nock

~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: there is probably a simple and intuitive way to
explain the trees
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: but damned if i know what
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; is in the building
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: the 2n / 2n + 1 explanation and the pascal&amp;#39;s
triangle-like explanation work well for explaining the structure
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: but as for actually parsing the things...
~dolrux-nomlup &amp;quot;nydwracu&amp;quot;: when they&amp;#39;re written out in one dimension...
~padpem-niddut &amp;quot;LeVeutre&amp;quot; is in the building

~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: it&amp;#39;s easy, if you&amp;#39;re a computer
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: fortunately you don&amp;#39;t really ever have to
use nock

~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: evening
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: or whatever
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Ave, ~labfes-larzod. It is near midnight, shipboard
(that is to say, Urbit Galactic) time.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: so we&amp;#39;re using utc
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: UGT, but yes.
~talhet-sidnus &amp;quot;zygen&amp;quot; is in the building
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: it&amp;#39;d be much easier to
remember how to convert from local to ugt
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: if daylight savings was
gotten rid of
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: abolished, that&amp;#39;s the word
i&amp;#39;m looking for
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Or if state clocks were permanently offset 1/24 of an
Earth rotation.
~talhet-sidnus &amp;quot;zygen&amp;quot; has left the building
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: or if we just used ugt for everything
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: it&amp;#39;d be easy to remember &amp;quot;ugt
is 6 hours ahead&amp;quot; if it wasn&amp;#39;t sometimes only 5
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: the easiest conversion to remember is
of course no conversion, but I suppose we&amp;#39;re a little ways away from that for
now

~nocsub-modbex &amp;quot;Admiral of the White&amp;quot; is in the building
~nocpyx-modbex [John Burnham] has left the building
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Ave, ~nocsub-modbex.
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: nocsub-modbex is me
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i&amp;#39;m bringing up several admirals for banner
moderation
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: I thought the arrogation of &amp;quot;Admiral&amp;quot; was a bit of a
bold claim.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: A reasonable idea.
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: tlon has an interest in keeping the banner
system operating properly
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: if, for example, someone spams a banner with
off-banner content
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: e.g. the %blues experience a torrent of %orange
aggression
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: tlon would like to know about it
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: we haven&amp;#39;t instituted a proper reputation system
yet
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: However, banners are fixed, horizontal associations.
Channel (or :room) moderation would seem more effective.
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: sure, for a chatroom
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: What powers could a banner admiral possess, if they
don&amp;#39;t control the kill-file? And if they do, how do they acquire it?
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: oh, for now there are no powers whatsoever
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i&amp;#39;m mostly interested in banner statistics and
activity
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: By design then, if not by present implementation.
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: so i know where i need to pay attention to
stoking the fires
~mirdem-nislux &amp;quot;Admiral of the Black&amp;quot; is in the building
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Are they to rely information to the actual :room
manager?
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: perhaps, i don&amp;#39;t really know what&amp;#39;s needed yet
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: but i just figured this way was more honest than
spawning some anons
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: 
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: It is, and I find the naval vernacular deeply appealing.
My curiosity was to whether some aspect of the longer term reputation hierarchy
was being revealed.
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: not at all, i just thought this up this
afternoon
~docfel-panmus &amp;quot;Admiral of the Red&amp;quot; is in the building
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: it may be a silly idea
~tamnyl-fotsed &amp;quot;Admiral of the Blue&amp;quot; is in the building
~labtyl-fapmer &amp;quot;Admiral of the Orange&amp;quot; is in the building
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: but at least it&amp;#39;s very pretty
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Are there any technical benefits to destroyer-level
%banner listeners that ~doznec does not already provide?
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: proper budgeting has both its
upside and downside
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i just found out that i am
probably not buying a couch this month
~navhul-lacsup [jacob (showtime) lyles]: 
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: yo navhul you blanked lined
in both
~navhul-lacsup [jacob (showtime) lyles]: can i check someone&amp;#39;s banner? 
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: In terminal, :hi ~shipname
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Then :thumb ~shipname
~navhul-lacsup [jacob (showtime) lyles]: sorry about that :(, I thought it
would &amp;quot;switch modes&amp;quot; if I hit enter with blank statement
~navhul-lacsup [jacob (showtime) lyles]: and it does
~navhul-lacsup [jacob (showtime) lyles]: but it also sends a blank line
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: well, looks like there&amp;#39;s a very valuable service
needed here
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; has left the building
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: some of the banners (i won&amp;#39;t say which) are
looking rather barren
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: yeah, there&amp;#39;s like nobody on %white
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: someone should be on them at all times just to
be friendly
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: yeah... that %white
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: so alone
~nocsub-modbex &amp;quot;Admiral of the White&amp;quot;: you don&amp;#39;t know how it feels
~nocsub-modbex &amp;quot;Admiral of the White&amp;quot;: banner messages just go to everyone
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: o rly
~nocsub-modbex &amp;quot;Admiral of the White&amp;quot;: but that&amp;#39;s the price you pay for
neutrality
~hobmed-hinrym [Steven (mrdomino) Dee]: so they do! but the prefix looks
different locally...
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: fantyv, the only technical benefits i can see
are separation of routing and moderation
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and the interface is cleaner
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] is in the building
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: but really, i&amp;#39;m mostly doing this for reasons of
situational awareness
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;:  ~doznec can presumably read all %banner traffic.
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: very true, cruisers have no banner
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: being network infrastructure
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: That was the next question.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Could ~doznec join its own :room?
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i believe it could
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: as could ~zod
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: but one wouldn&amp;#39;t want to use the voice of ~zod
for banner chitchat
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: could we start our own :rooms
and chat in them?
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: learn hoon and then yes, probably :)
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;:  ~novrud-hanweb has done so.
:~novrud-hanweb/try=/bin/chat
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: sure, but you&amp;#39;ve got to modify the :chat code a
little
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: so it doesn&amp;#39;t conflict
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: hmm
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: tomsyt, to go back to my earlier
inquiries, i&amp;#39;m starting to wonder if arm names are actually stored in the
core&amp;#39;s formula at all
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: or if they&amp;#39;re part of the type?
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: i suppose i&amp;#39;m going to have to actually
understand the compiler guts to answer that question myself :)
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: tnh, dondep, i dunno either
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: what do you mean by arm names?
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: the text after ++ 
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: before the twig
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] has left the building
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: figuring this out is made harder by the
fact that ++ appears to not be a hoon.
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: hmm, that&amp;#39;s a good question, how is slus handled
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: around line 6409, in ++scat
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: so far as I can tell.
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: hang on, my line numbers are different
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i&amp;#39;m in the middle of adding sha-512 to our hash
library
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: which, as an algorithm, is kinda overkill
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: but ed25519 needs it
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: (our signature function for cryptosuite b)
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: it&amp;#39;s a nice thing to have, yep
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: anyway, i don&amp;#39;t grok this part of hoon.hoon
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i really have to go read that tile doc again and
more slowly
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: okay! good to know i&amp;#39;m not the only bozo
on this bus.
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i think pretty much everyone here is in the same
boat...
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: err, bus
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: except for cgy of course
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: our fearless driver/pilot/leader
~monder-navryx &amp;quot;LarryH&amp;quot;: little kids honk my big red nose all the time
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: i should play with the parsing combinators
a bit.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: we&amp;#39;ve supposedly got a json generator,
maybe i should write a json parser. :)
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: The :chat log on urbit.org seems to be missing content.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Any text following a &amp;quot;|&amp;quot; is not displayed, nor is it
present in the page source.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: that&amp;#39;s on purpose, I believe.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: banner chat is for Secret Plans.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: It was a discussion of prefixes in %white-space.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Specifically: ~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Only %blue comrades
would see this, and your prompt
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: would change from &amp;amp; to 
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: The final two characters should be &amp;quot;|.&amp;quot;
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot; is in the building
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: I don&amp;#39;t have a personal copy of the :chat history with
which to compare, but the ommission occurs repeatedly.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: oh, ha.
~dondep-radtud [Allen (dash) Short]: someone&amp;#39;s regex is flawed, I suppose.
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: ahhhhhhhhh
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: yes, duh
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: my regex was flawed
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: very very flawed
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: hang on will fix
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Also, ~shipname, automatically creates a new line.
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: yes, same flaw
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: forgot to add ^
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: for start of line
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: It&amp;#39;s not universal, ~zod stays in-line.
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: yeah, my regex was \~.{6}-.{6}
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: or actually ......
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: instead of .{6}
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: regexes in vim are slightly strange
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: different escaping than sed
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Roger, roger.

   <link href="http://urbit.org/2014/01/15/net.html"/>
   <updated>2014-01-15T06:59:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://urbit.org/2014/01/15/net</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The quoted material comes from an email sent by Curtis Yarvin– my reply is in-line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general idea of Urbit has always been to use the potential value of the namespace to drive its development. Partly this involves doing what we’ve done, which is to create a company and get funding from evil VCs. But fundamentally, Urbit remains an open-source project - for example, there is no secret codebase - and we can’t really succeed without public contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urbit is a labor of love, and I’d like to see it go far. Cosmic, even. I doubt anyone will begrudge you for acting within the guidelines of today’s Corporations-Are-People mindset, especially since the entire operation has been transparent since the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, as in all open-source projects, people have contributed and will contribute to Urbit, because Urbit is cool and fun. If they are in a sense being paid, or expected to be paid, for this work, Urbit becomes less cool and fun. So we don’t want to see the real estate as in any sense a bounty, a payment, a prize, etc, etc. A crucial element of the scheme is that those who win, win without any prior expectation of winning. This preserves the fun factor. I hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fun, for me, is in helping to create a virtual world, from scratch, using no more than some simple mechanical rules. Urbit is fun, and I’m pleased by how well my contributions have been accepted. This is already rewarding, though, of course, I’m not saying ‘no’ to a carrier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owning an Urbit carrier is more than just a reward - it is also a duty. Urbit is a digital republic, and as a carrier owner you are literally a senator of this republic. For the moment, of course, the republic is tiny and it does not need republican government - it needs a dictator. As it grows and succeeds, its governance must and will become not only republican, but even democratic. I hope this doesn’t shock anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems clear that those who accept this duty (you can always decline) should be defined by one word: virtue. A virtuous republic is impossible without virtuous governors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One time, I was talking about Urbit, and someone summarized it as “It sounds like you’re kind of important in this imaginary world.” I shouldn’t let this talk get to my head, but it gets difficult when you send out messages about how important my participation can be. ;) Now I get to talk about being a Rear Admiral in the Urbit Republic, or something along those lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, I’ve decided to issue urbit.org carriers in the following way: distribution is in rounds, each of which is defined by a previously unannounced virtue. For instance, in 2010, I committed to issuing carriers to anyone who could write decrement in Nock. I promised a prize to be disclosed later. I don’t think anyone had any idea that this prize would be something you could sell (please don’t, though!) for over $10,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You can’t even buy these for dollars,” Y.T. says, of her skateboard. I’m humbled by this reward, and to sell it would be completely contrary to the virtue expected of us. `@udd`10.000 is certainly a number, but its type isn’t compatible with ++zeno.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this is to say that I’ll take this duty seriously. Sinking a carrier makes a large portion of the address space go dark, a complication we can all do without. Urbit is easy, uncomplicated, and fun, but fun can’t exist without some serious work behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was the virtue of the 2010 winners? One of the classic virtues - luck. They did the right thing in the right place at the right time. Hence, in the carrier database their carriers are listed as “per fortuna.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It still surprises me that Nock, as we know it, has been around this long. We live in a culture where something from 3 months ago is considered old news, which makes the `fortuna’ carrier-holders ancient&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this round we’re celebrating a different virtue - loyalty to Urbit. Your carrier is “per fidelis.” This reflects the fact that for the last three months, more or less, you have showed up, chatted, evangelized, sent bug reports, worked through the doc, etc, etc, etc. Without any expectation of being rewarded for this, obviously. It is the lack of expectation that makes the reward genuinely effective, and not overjustified. I hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The experience of poking around in this digital labyrinth is utterly addictive. Even without the potential for reward, Urbit would hold my attention, so the reward is indeed effective. (I hope.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you are a present carrier holder, feel free to look through ++zeno and pick any carrier that is presently assigned to me or to Tlon, other than ~zod of course. We’ll adjust the bindings as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the idea of holding carrier ~net, `@p`79. The associations for that number are mostly favorable, and I won’t belabor the point by listing them all out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a final note. I recognize that having a carrier means giving up most of the privacy I sought in the atax1a mask, but that privacy was illusory (and orthogonal to Urbit) anyway. This is the price of living in our modern world.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; is bemused by the @p and @da having text-span versions.
Almost like you did that to break the runes someone came up with, and force
them to use names. :)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the reason to have them directly in the subject
is that you often want to use them in path
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: s
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: sure
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so -&amp;gt;- and -&amp;gt;+, instead of just -&amp;gt;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: one more character, you get two versions
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; nods.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and paths really do have to be text.  because,
you know, text
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: that -+&amp;lt;&amp;gt; is so great, it imitates the way my poor brain
would walk down the tree doubling and incrementing, only effortlessly
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; really likes this model of computation on a single
subject.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes, life is much better without the silly
&amp;quot;environment&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] can&amp;#39;t wait to see what happens when programmers
who grew up in hoon are introduced to 20th-century languages
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t let perl&amp;#39;s elegant syntax lead you astray: it&amp;#39;s
not as easy as it looks!&amp;quot;
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; grew up speaking Perl.
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot; too.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Hoon&amp;#39;s syntax is crystal-clear to me!
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; &amp;#39;s physical manifestation appears to have communication
problems, though.
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: try drawing a cartoon
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: I ask a coworker to test something before giving it to
the customer, and he does the opposite.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; wonders in what universe &amp;quot;Do not give this to the
customer&amp;quot; translates into &amp;quot;hand straight to the customer&amp;quot;.
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: draw a cartoon where he gives it to the customer, then a
princess appears and explodes him ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] is
in the building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Next time I&amp;#39;m in Japan, I&amp;#39;ll just give him a real-life
reenactment of some Unicode Emoji on his desk.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] resists the temptation to use unicode emoji as
hoons
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] but still wants to use them as output-only
markers
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: eg, pile of poo for your stack traces...
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: ew
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: what about CAT FACE WITH WRY SMILE
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: that would be better
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] thinks pile of poo is too new to be reliable
anyway
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; just found some buried treasure in this codebase!
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: We truncate some 64-bit values to 32-bits, and have
done so for nearly the entire lifetime of the product
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s okay if there are less than 4 billion
sered
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: served
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] always wonders whether or not to check for
32-bit reference count overflow
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: rev45000-ish has the lines introducing this issue. The
most recent rev is 1127622.  ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] has
left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] doesn&amp;#39;t know what the software is but that
sounds like a lot of revisions
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: it would be fewer revisions if anyone besides me
wanted to learn the version control software.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] imagines a future where every keystroke gets its
own change number
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; imagines a past where this software worked properly.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;this&amp;quot; being my reality, not Urbit. Urbit always works
properly, in  both the past and the future.  | ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]
imagines a past where lots of things worked properly, Detroit existed and the
army could win a war
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Urbit has always existed, I got the code in a
time machine
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: I got the code on a USB stick at DEFCON.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Which is canceled this year, by the way.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: really?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: why?
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: Defcon is cancelled?
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: The Dark Tangent retired last year. Plus, I heard they
sold out of tickets already.  ~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] can&amp;#39;t find this on his googles, perhaps he lives
in an alternate 2014
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: they must not have updated the website!
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is actually pretty confident that Urbit has made
contact with one of the other 2014s
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: either that or he&amp;#39;s being trolled...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] sighs.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is just not cool.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: sometimes, one should not trust content from
hiddem-lomder.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: or hatteb-mitlyd...
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: or rigryx-sovrus. let&amp;#39;s just get all my ships out
there.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has been too generous, frankly
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; was surprised to get 4, honestly.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has billions.  or did before he started giving
them away.  ~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; is in the building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; is ready to surrender all but one as penance for its
acts of trolling.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] just offered four carriers to probably our last
angel/seed investor, if he comes through
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: obviously the same deal is available to anyone
here if he/she has 250K under the couch
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: also ~nyt is currently going, going... at 11.7
bitcoins
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which makes your destroyers worth...
approximately... 0.001 cents each
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: of course they have much greater sentimental
value!
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has almost 1/3 the market cap of Dogecoin.~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] still wonders what the hizzy is ~balweb-sarlyt
[Mark Zavislak] has left the building ~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot; has left the
building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: http://tweetnacl.cr.yp.to/software.html - curve25519
and related functions in convenient twitterable form.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that is so djb.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] imagines a world where djb is a billionaire and
Zuckerberg asks if you want fries with that.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; wants to live in that world. Maybe it can have a BeOS
phone, too.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] used to work for the guy who wrote the BeOS
filesystem.  or one of them.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Giampolo?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Schillings.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: maybe he was the second guy on it or something.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] thinks he&amp;#39;s at Yahoo now or something.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: he was my boss at Openwave after Bruce Schwartz
left the building.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but Be was one of the last great system
software companies.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Giampaolo wrote the BeFS that replaced OFS,
apparently. I never used OFS, I think that was in the pre-R3 Be...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yeah maybe Schillings was OFS.  I don&amp;#39;t know.
I never used a Be myself... but it was cool.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; only used the x86 port.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: all that is solid melts into air.  except for
Urbit of course.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] wishes FirefoxOS wasn&amp;#39;t so lame.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; wishes the web weren&amp;#39;t so lame, and has words to say
about people&amp;#39;s lack of attention span.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] sees lame all around him, and not just on his
computer.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; believes twitter and facebook and youtube to have
reduced people&amp;#39;s attention spans to less than 5 minutes.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] doesn&amp;#39;t use either twitter or facebook, for
precisely that reason
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] shows his kids youtube sometimes and feels
guilty about it, also for that reason ~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot; is in the building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; uses twitter, but posts to it from IRC. Occasionally
has issues because even IRC&amp;#39;s buffer is larger than twitter&amp;#39;s.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] can&amp;#39;t believe there is an entire
multimillion-dollar company whose raison d&amp;#39;etre is posting to twitter as a cron
job.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: speaking of buffers...
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: and speaking of curves:
https://www.imperialviolet.org/2013/12/25/elligator.html
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: elligator, for those unfamiliar, is a scheme to ensure
that an elliptic-curve point is indistinguishable from a random string.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: this is a desirable property.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hm, that looks kind of interesting
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: burnham is more the math expert on this one...
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; is an armchair mathematician. Actually, an armchair
everything.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Years of fell and fugitive life has atrophied the
human element in me...  ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] is in the
building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] had a human element but it burned out~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] has left the building ~racbes-solmun
&amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot; has left the building ~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc] has left the
building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; pictures tasfyn as a hoon-emitting robot ~novrud-hanweb
&amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; is in the building ~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; has left the building~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: do not use teh ^W, not when you have
applications running
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: Sorry guys, nandchat is gone
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the event routing, she is not working so good
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: gone?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: dead, kaput, pushing up teh daisies?
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I managed to quit all of my apps now I get %time-lost
p=51 q=0 r=/wa
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: and %flub {}
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: can I recover from this by replaying ?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] thinks not.  ~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; is in the
building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: on the other hand, you seem to be okay, so...
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: it kind of looks like the trick to get it back was to
press ^W again
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is not responsible for the outcome of any such
tricks.
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: maybe it&amp;#39;s just the submarine that&amp;#39;s hosed
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the n-word chat does appear to be working
nromally ~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham] has left the building ~midlys-rocpet
[John Burnham] has left the building ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] has left the
building ~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] gathered that.  ~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; has left
the building
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: guys the color of the stuff coming out of
my nose is starting to get close to the color of my (green) handkerchief
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: just fyi
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] caught con flu at 30c3 it seems
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] doesn&amp;#39;t know what it looks like but he knows
what it sounds like ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne] is in the
building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] hears labfes-larzod will be out in SF pretty
soon ~rovrel-bicmyl is in the building
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: yes
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] welcomes rovrel-bicmyl
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: last week of february
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: well, that&amp;#39;s soon enough I guess..
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: at the rate i expect work and
such to cause the weeks to fly by
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: god help us if we don&amp;#39;t actually have some hoon
doc by then
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ha ha, actually I&amp;#39;m just finishing up chapter 7
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: cool
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: with any luck i might
understand some hoon by then
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: by february even little girls will know hoon
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: yeah but little girls
probably don&amp;#39;t get home from work and open up beers
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] plans to teach his daughter at least one hoon
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: depends on your little girl I guess
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: mine gets home from school and opens up
pbskids.org
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I assume that because it&amp;#39;s PBS it can&amp;#39;t be
rotting her brain
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: hahaha
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i wouldn&amp;#39;t make that
assumption
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s PBS!  it&amp;#39;s educational!  haha.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: maybe not but it tranquilizes her and gets her
off my hands.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is not necessarily always the parent he ought to
be.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: it&amp;#39;s interactive, at least, i
suppose
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: indeed.  and even somewhat literate.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: make sure you have an
adblocker installed
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] &amp;#39;s daughter probably wouldn&amp;#39;t go for a
first-person shooter anyway, she&amp;#39;s pretty girly
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i&amp;#39;m pretty sure the worst
thing about watching tv was the ads
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: PBS doesn&amp;#39;t have ads, it has public service
announcements
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] isn&amp;#39;t sure there&amp;#39;s any such thing as a
public-service announcement blocker
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: or a words-from-our-sponsor blocker
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: PBS is for the chic, it even has chic ads
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: because i was a college
student and was living in a small apartment
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i never bothered to get a TV
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] takes another pull on the meth pipe and reaches
for some Cheetos
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: so every time i see ads on TV
now, i get really weirded out by them
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] grew up without a TV, he is from a chic family
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i watched plenty of tv as a
kid
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: not wealthy, but quite communist nonetheless~balweb-sarlyt [Mark Zavislak] is in the building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; gets more information out of TV when the sound is off.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: communists don&amp;#39;t believe in TV, it is one of
their many cultural superiorities
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] welcomes balweb-sarlyt.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: anyway it&amp;#39;s not just TV that
is the problem
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: it&amp;#39;s the advertising
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: because ads are actually
incomprehensible mishmashes
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s not the TV or the advertising
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s the audience...
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: well there&amp;#39;s that too
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the lesson of PBS is that advertising for chic
people can be and is chic
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: an audience that can extract
anything from those ads, an audience that is meaningfully targetted by those
ads, is in trouble
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] doesn&amp;#39;t need to see that to know that his
country is in trouble
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: he works at 10th and Mission, after all~balweb-sarlyt [Mark Zavislak] has left the building
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i guess i will see 10th and
mission soon enough
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: he could throw a stone and hit the Twitter
headquarters.  also, three pot stores.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: really
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; offended Twitter security by not having his license
name match the logbook.  \/ ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes.  there&amp;#39;s the
upscale pot store, the middle-scale pot store, and the hilariously downscale
pot store that can&amp;#39;t even get it together to hav\/ e a proper sign.  \/
\/
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: well i might have to try that
(the stone throwing part (jk))
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] suggests that he should have chilled out by
going around the corner to &amp;quot;Re-Leaf.&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: don&amp;#39;t throw stones at Twitter, I think their
security is pretty good...
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Turns out, identifying as Eugene Belford and then not
presenting an ID with that name on it, bothers some people.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i never got around to doing
that to the tumblr hq in NYC!!!
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yeah it might!
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] likes to sign in as Robert E. Lee.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: who&amp;#39;s a dead ringer for Ben Bernanke, by the
way.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i wonder how far the BV sf
outpost is from twitter hq
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: From PR Gnus in Washington,
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: BV?
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: bazaarvoice
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ah right that&amp;#39;s where you work
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: one wonders how many people think:
&amp;quot;BizarreVoice&amp;quot;... a very different kind of startup...
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: yep
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: every time
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: every single time
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] practices his bizarre voice.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that&amp;#39;s okay, I&amp;#39;m a tone-deaf founder myself
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: &amp;quot;Tlon&amp;quot; sounds like a Bond villain company name.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s even worse on our legal docs, which all
say &amp;quot;Tlon Corporation.&amp;quot;
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: how do you even pronounce it
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: T&amp;#39;lon.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: oh
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Tuh-lon.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: ohh
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i was thinking tee-lon
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: &amp;quot;Our reporters have learned that Tlon
Corporation has been secretly introducing LSD into your water supply...&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: actually we need to become a megacorporation so
we can have a security arm - Tlon Global Security.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] always trusts content from Tlon Corporation.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: heh
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: hahahha
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Tlon Heavy Industries
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Tlon Propulsion Systems
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: the always trust content
thing tho will be more literally true of BV
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; snickers.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: how so?
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: We&amp;#39;ve all seen Videodrome, yes?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is actually sadly limited in this category
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but he was thinking about always trusting
content...
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: give me a sec let me see if
there is a link
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; was going in the direction of malish company names.

http://www.bazaarvoice.com/authenticity/ of course there is a link
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] used to know a tiny multimedia company called
&amp;quot;Colossal Pictures.&amp;quot;
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: hahhha
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: ... i just noticed that when
i think of the word colossal the first thing i think is &amp;quot;hard to lift&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] was actually thinking of

~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: HAHAHAH
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: The head of Spectacular Optical says something like...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but #EndFakeReviews sounds a little like
#EndPoverty
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: We make inexpensive glasses for the Third World and
missile guidance systems for NATO. We also make Videodrome, Max.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: hashtags are a key component
of modern marketing campaigns
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: not because anyone actually
uses them
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: but because they suggest
hipness etc
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes.  but eventually this becomes ridiculous
and then played-out.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: anyway, everyone wants to end poverty, but it&amp;#39;s
not clear how to do it
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: true | ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis
Yarvin]: actually I have a plan but it&amp;#39;s not really a politically correct one
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and the same is true of fake reviews...  |~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Is it a modest proposal?  | ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis
Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s a rather immodest proposal.  | ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]:
really San Francisco specific.  | ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it involves
the Farallons...  | ~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Reduce the Bay Area to glass?
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: well the engineers on the
teams in question say they&amp;#39;ve got an idea | ~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth
(raptros) coyne]: 
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: fake reviews are spam, so if you can end
spam...
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: 
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: I had to deal with an oldweb way of handling spam
recently.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: well there&amp;#39;s a way to end
spam if you&amp;#39;re in-control enough
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has to wash his hands every time he handles spam
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: It was unpleasant and I don&amp;#39;t think it adds any
security, just makes it harder to send email.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: but uh given the events of
today, i probably shouldn&amp;#39;t get into it too much
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: cuil theory?  Wasn&amp;#39;t that a failed startup,
Cuil?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: heh the Judge is not amused.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: cuil was hilarious. the cpedia gave me so much
amusement in those boring moments during school.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;I know! Let&amp;#39;s markov-chain a search engine AND
wikipedia!&amp;quot;
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: what was cpedia
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: basically what i just typed.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: oh
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: oh no
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: You would search for something, and get a mishmash of
Wikipedia and web content.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Not &amp;amp;ing kitting.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: kidding, either.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: dude that&amp;#39;s hilarious, I totally missed it
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this is why Urbit does not go out seeking teh
press
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: the press is a monster

~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: this one: ?:  &amp;amp; 47 52
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]:  is yes (true)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so, the result is 47
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: oh okay!
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: what&amp;#39;s no?  !?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: no is |
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: yes &amp;amp; 0
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: no | 1
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: believe this is actually mentioned in a
previous chapter
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that&amp;#39;s correct
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but there is a lot of very confusing material
coming quite quickly...
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: there was a promise early on that the reader is not too
stupid to learn Hoon
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: :S
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: the reader should probably start from the beginning of
the hoon part again...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the writer may be too stupid to teach it
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: thank you for the nice doc though!  once it&amp;#39;s metabolized
it&amp;#39;ll probably have been great!
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s actually a lot harder than I thought, but
yes, in the structure I wound up with
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you probably want to go through it twice
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: did 7 come out last night/this morning?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: last night eh
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but I forgot to send an email
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a 3-year-old was jumping on my head

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: also I&amp;#39;m going to give the chapters actual
titles, the jokey ones are becoming lame

~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: hoon is adopted by a nice family
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: hoon eats their baby
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: hoon gets rabies?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: rumors that hoon has rabies are entirely false
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it may have leprosy... or elephantiasis... but
not rabies!

~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: yeah, after you implement your own nock evaluator of any
variety
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hoon just doesn&amp;#39;t add that much over nock
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: except that you can actually program in it...
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: at present, *you* can actually program in it...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes.  also a couple of other people
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but we&amp;#39;ll get there... really... we will
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: I&amp;#39;m still seeing ascii soup, but I hope it&amp;#39;ll pass
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it will pass once you start using it
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a good test is how easy it is to see syntax
errors
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: syntax errors feel physically painful and I see
them instantly
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: like a missing brace in C
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but at this point... ascii soup
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we need lots of cool fun exercises, preferably
that serve webpages
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: yup
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: btw is the http server an arvo-level thing or a
vere-level thing?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is arvo avec le collaboration of vere
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that is, vere is doing events at the http level
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: not at the tcp level, we don&amp;#39;t have a tcp level
event system yet
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] feels less uncomfortable about gating vere
directly to tcp than he used to
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: I&amp;#39;d really love to see an exposition of the vere/arvo
interface.  i.e. what&amp;#39;s the protocol for calling the operating function
(operating core?) etc
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the closest thing is ++card in zuse.hoon
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but it is poorly organized and contains both
input events and output actiojns
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: but I&amp;#39;m probably just damaged in being so interested in
that ~lapled-rammyn [Jordan Lewis] has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: also if you look at the Postface in hoon.hoon,
this is the interface of the outermost core
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: about 8 arms
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the main one is ++poke, ie, send an event and
convert it into a new state and a list of actins
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: actions, actins are proteins
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: now that&amp;#39;s some hoon-learning motivation right there
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] likes that he attracts more systems guys than
language guys
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: after all, the #1 reason why any language ever
has been adopted:
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s the default language on some OS people
wanted to use.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: C is better than Pascal but that&amp;#39;s not why it
beats Pascal...  ~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot; is in the building ~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;

~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: but every so often i get a scrolling set of
flubs
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: that only ctrl-w fixes
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i will experiment
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: in the meantime
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: my second face is here ~tomsyt-balsen [John
Burnham] has left the building
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: ah, that&amp;#39;s interesting
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: apparently the submarine is completely dead
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: but the destroyer is fine
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: i can&amp;#39;t ctrl-w into the sub
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: and i only get the flubs when i&amp;#39;m running chat~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; has left the building ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] is in
the building
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: have my sub and destroyer done a vulcan
mind-meld?
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: are they now, in fact, the same ship?
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: this whole thing of having multiple ships on a
pier seems slightly suspect
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: let&amp;#39;s see if i can trigger another sequences of
flubs
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: flub?
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: oh that&amp;#39;s bizarre
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: let&amp;#39;s test from the other end
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i was in chat
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: did a ctrl-w
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: to tomsyt-balsen
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: which was odd
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: ~tomsyt-balsen/try=&amp;gt;
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i ran a second chat
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and now i&amp;#39;m chatting from the second one
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and am getting atrocious terminal lag
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and yet still urbit refuses to die
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: this aint no soviet engineering
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: let&amp;#39;s see if i can cause more mischief
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: success!
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: i got my sequence of flubs!
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: the bugs is fscking reproducible
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: let&amp;#39;s try to reproduce it again
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: am now in a second chat on the phantom tomsyt
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: which has eaten my sub
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: now i do a ctrl-d ~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; is in
the building
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i get my flubs
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and then a ctrl-w stops the flubbing
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: fascinating
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i can&amp;#39;t wait to hear cgy explain this one
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: if i had to guess, it&amp;#39;s that running a phantom
chat on the second ship
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: looks like the same process to incoming packets
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: but looks like a different process to outgoing
packets
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: so i kill the second process
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: on the phantom ship
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and i get %time-lost until i switch away
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: but the interesting thing is that i still get
filesystem events from the submarine
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: hang on, i&amp;#39;m gonna try to run a program on the
sub
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: it works!
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: my submarine is now my neighbor
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: even though i can no longer get on it
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i vaguely recall someone finding this bug at
some point in the past
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: tomsyt: i can&amp;#39;t say I&amp;#39;ve read everything you
said but that all happened to me yesterday
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: ^w made the flums go away
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: etc
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: *flubs
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and ^w sets it off
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: working on a submarine, I was trying to see
if I could get it to join :~novrud-hanweb/try=/bin/chat
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: when I tried a sub that didn&amp;#39;t have another
ship in the pier, it worked
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: that&amp;#39;s peculiar, innit?
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: all i can say for certain is that something,
somewhere is getting confused
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i&amp;#39;ll ask cgy about it
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: although he&amp;#39;ll probably see my giant wall of
text next time he&amp;#39;s on
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i&amp;#39;d apologize for spamming, but the urbiverse
has been quiet today
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: the store and forward architecture is going
to help me get over my addiction to hackernews
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: here, there is no illusion that I can or
should read everything
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: ...I read everything
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: but then again, i suppose that that&amp;#39;s my job
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: that&amp;#39;s great, I can&amp;#39;t even find time to
finish reading the hoon docs
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: I just fixed a ruby thing though
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: what sort of ruby thing?
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: there&amp;#39;s this mechanize script that worked
with mint.com up til a few days ago
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: mint-exporter
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: to log you in and download a CSV of all your
transactions
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: but what would one do with said CSV?
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: looks like they made everything very
javascripty without any user-visible difference
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: mechanize doesn&amp;#39;t work anymore
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: use it to reconcile (say) a ledger
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: it&amp;#39;s very hard to get data out of mint.com
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: are there mint competitors that let you import
csvs?
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: there&amp;#39;s no API, they don&amp;#39;t want one
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: &amp;lt;-
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: not a competitor so much as beeminder
integration
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: working on it
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: this is one of the pain points we here in the
urbiverse are trying to solve
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: all your mint data should live in your home
folder
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: or rather main/lib
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: well a ledger is one of those things that&amp;#39;s
kind of hard to do with the variability of data
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: mint does a pretty good job with showing you
the balance of cash accounts
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: but there&amp;#39;s often no transaction to show when
the balance goes down
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: I feel like I should have a page that shows
me a red light for each pending transaction that hasn&amp;#39;t been recorded yet
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: since it&amp;#39;s one of the things that each
different bank probably does differently
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: M&amp;amp;T Bank does a crappy job of delivering the
news for instance
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: I suspect
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: but anyway the mint-exporter with
capybara-webkit support is up, if I knew how to use capybara correctly it would
be awesome but it works
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]:

~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: test
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: John you fixed that nasty -- problem in markdown... nice
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: https://github.com/Katee/quietnet
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: yeah that hephep problem was annoying
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: apparently github flavoured markdown interprets
-- as a horizontal rule
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: even though the md specs say that an &amp;lt;hr&amp;gt; is
three heps
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: and even inside of a code block
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: so i had to use GHMD&amp;#39;s code block fencing syntax
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: n.b. quietnet is a chat program that uses
no sockets or bluetooth connections of any kind
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: which maruku on my laptop doesn&amp;#39;t process
properly
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: at least there was an easy workarond
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: i&amp;#39;m surprised that hoon syntax doesn&amp;#39;t cause more
problems with markdown!
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: except now i have to put changes on the web
before i can see whether they worked or not
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: but it&amp;#39;s fine
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: i&amp;#39;m just griping
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: you&amp;#39;d think that having raised $100m, GH would
have its shit together
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: does gfm use redcarpet still?~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot; is in the building
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: evening, ~racbes-solmun
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: good evening
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: tonight&amp;#39;s stupidity excuse: head cold
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] empathizes
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: that is, I am also using that as a
stupidity excuse
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: in reality, I have no more excuses
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: I have a hoon repl on a local machine
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: and three whole chapters of doc
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: but also more distractions than there were up on the
mountain
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: and a head cold.
~foprex-lanfen [Kingdon Barrett]: why is the rum gone
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: i also have a head cold
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: which is making this process of grokking edwards
curves more annoying than it should be
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: fortunately i also have tomato soup
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] empathizes re distractions
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: turns out there&amp;#39;s a bunch of stuff going
on in the city
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: drastic difference from that one day I
kept living for most of last year!
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: hey, man you only do two days
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: the day you enter
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: and the day you leave
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] hums Cosmic Charlie
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSXm4FUmE5g
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: i love the wire
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: quite confident that people will still be
watching the wire
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: long after baltimore ceases to exist
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: which, at present trends...
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: hmm. i am receiving every chat message twice.
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: that sounds like a problem
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: that sounds like a problem
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: &amp;gt;_&amp;gt;
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: ctrl-x cycles through processes. if you
ctrl-x twice and see two &amp;#39;&amp;amp;&amp;#39;s, ctrl-d on one of them
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: if not, I defer to ~bilsym-bisner
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: aha. i think i&amp;#39;m good now.
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: Probably hit ctrl-x out of emacs reflex.
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] nods
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: I suppose one day we will have an emacs
urbit mode
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: we may also have an urbit emacs mode, but
that one frightens me ~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot; has left the building
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: gnu emacs needs to die
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: as son as possible
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: write us an editor in hoon!
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: hoon can&amp;#39;t be any more confusing and uncomfortable
than elisp
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: in my experience, it is until it isn&amp;#39;t
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: (I speak as a loyal emacs user and elisp author of
15 years)
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: of course, my experience is atypical.
most people will learn Hoon from comprehensive, friendly docs. I learned Hoon
as koan practice.  ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] is in the
building ~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot; is in the building
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: hmm. what are all these %flub %time-lost messages
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: if you scroll back up the chat log, i have
involved journey through the time-lost flubs
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: *an involved ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen)
Wolfe-Pauly] has left the building
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: basically, don&amp;#39;t hit ctrl-w
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: it causes flubs
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: but if you do get flubbed
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: ctrl-w fixes it
~bilsym-bisner [John Burnham]: it&amp;#39;s very strange
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: of course, if you haven&amp;#39;t hit ctrl-w,
this might bear further investigation
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] approves of &amp;quot;lul&amp;quot; as an abbreviation for

~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: luslus is for teh lulz?
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: i did hit C-w
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: i guess that falls under &amp;quot;doctor doctor, it hurts
when I do this&amp;quot;
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: Anyway re broken destroyer, I did copy my passphrase
over from .urbit
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: what&amp;#39;s the deal with the entropy entered for :begin
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: if I recreate my pier and get that wrong, what would
the symptoms be?
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: you wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to create your
destroyer
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: you also wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to create your
destroyer if you got it right, at the moment...
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: ha
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: recreating destroyers within a continuity
era is coming soon
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: or rather ownership transfers
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: the flub should be salvageable, though --
have you gotten it?
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: okay. i&amp;#39;ve got a different destroyer that i haven&amp;#39;t
been able to get working recently
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: let me try ot restart it and i&amp;#39;ll pastebin the log~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short] is in the building
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: hello, is this on
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: sorta
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: huh. well that works now
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: oh. it half works.
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: it can send but not receive. curious.
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: which destroyer?
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: ~malmec-libsev ~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]
has left the building
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: aha. it can&amp;#39;t receive? that&amp;#39;s surprising.
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: yes. :hi ~zod hangs indefinitely ~malmec-libsev
[Allen (dash) Short] is in the building
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: *blink*
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: huh. chat join/leave works
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: but = doesn&amp;#39;t
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: ok i hit C-d in that one but we don&amp;#39;t get a leave
notification. wacky ~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; has left the building
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: are you still flubbing?
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: no flubs, here or there ~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash)
Short] has left the building
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: puzzling.
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: see http://bpaste.net/show/rqqwFwUJofwUssRmnIrT/
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: :update just hangs at [waiting...] until C-d
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: you have john and I flubbergasted. can
you drydock that pier and send it to curtis?
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: sure, how do I do that :)
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: tar czf mypier.tar.gz mypier
urb/$mydestroyer urb/$mysub ~/.urbit/$mypassfile
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: ah. I thought &amp;#39;drydock&amp;#39; might involve
exporting/modifying stuff :)
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: well, it does. just not in urbit. :-p
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: heh heh
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: also don&amp;#39;t run that pier after you send
it in, of course
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: i could see that causing problems yes.
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: two instances of the same pier running on
the network will do strange and terrible things ~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash)
Short] is in the building
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: couldn&amp;#39;t resist one last try before packing it off.
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;:  now :hi ~zod succeeds but still no receipt in :chat
or :update
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;  tars it up
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: I am starting to vaguely suspect that
you&amp;#39;re just dealing with some sort of network delay
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: well
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: both piers are on the same network, just different
hosts 
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: and it worked on that host a few days ago~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short] has left the building
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: hmm
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: well, in any case, send it in and we&amp;#39;ll
see what we can come up with

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]:  good morning peoples
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: hail!
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: curious to see some of these bugs reported
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I guess malmec-libsev was messing around with
^W, huh
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a rather dangerous pastime in the present state
of things...
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: too bad :chat can&amp;#39;t east the ^W since that seems to be
the only time there is an issue
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: *eat*
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that would be a very bruceacious way of fixing
it :-)
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: not a fix... just a way to get by until it gets fixed
properlty
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: i&amp;#39;ve been cured of ^W myself ~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; is in
the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but no, it gets processed by batz first and we
need it in other places
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: of course ~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; has left the building
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: hey, nobody said it was dangerous... :)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I did somewhere in a cellar with a &amp;quot;beware of
the leopard&amp;quot; sign on the door
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: ah, of course.
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: what&amp;#39;s next to get documented? web services? (hint hint)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: plenty more language doc is on the way
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: web services are great of course but some arvo
level cleanup is necessary as well
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we&amp;#39;ll probably do a simultaneous doc and
cleanup at this level
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but there are a few more chapters of language
doc ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] is in the building ~talsur-todres [Galen
(galen) Wolfe-Pauly] is in the building
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: the last one was very helpful but got a bit challenging
towards the end! e.g.
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: [%brdt *]  [%brcn (~(put by *(map term foot)) %$ [%ash
p.gen])]
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: i know... obvious to the average peasant..~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; is in the building ~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; has left the
building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes all we&amp;#39;re doing in that line is putting the
foot in the core with a name of $
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: probably should be less intimidating than it is
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: a foot of ash...  ~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; has left the
building ~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; is in the building
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: what is obvious to the average peasant is deadly to the
average pheasant

[Curtis Yarvin] has left the building ~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is in the

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] looks at the time
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hatteb, do you have the skinny on that slow
destroyer?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the time is ~2014.1.13..19.12.01..9ffd
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: just so ya know
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] assumes everyone is reading chapter 7 with
savage assiduous diligence
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: performance goes in and out, really. sometimes it
works great, but when it&amp;#39;s processing a large bolus of data (like :chat
backlog)
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: it goes to pot.  ~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; has left the
building ~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot; has left the building ~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;
is in the building
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: top says it&amp;#39;s in kqread state, most of the time.~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; is in the building ~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; has left the
building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] doesn&amp;#39;t know kqread state off the top of his
head.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: he does know his interpreter isn&amp;#39;t the fastest
thing in the world
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the chat backlog involves a bunch of
interpreted things - interpreted printing, interpreted network protocol...
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: kqread is in the bowels of libuv, most likely. I&amp;#39;ll
just blame interpreter inefficiency for the time being.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: also, &amp;quot;goes to pot&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#39;t mean what you think
it means, I don&amp;#39;t think
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes it&amp;#39;s almost certainly a waiting state
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: what exactly happened?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hm, doznec paused oddly for a moment
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] will blame Digital Ocean inefficiency for that
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: it pauses oddly, and consumes all of its time on a
single CPU. :) ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: when does it pause oddly?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] pauses evenly.
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: it pauses oddly, but i cannot correlate it with any
time in particular.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] finds this bug report unsatisfying.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] finds your lack of specificity disturbing.
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: it does seem to be related to the network, though. i
can get it to brifly eat a CPU by chatting, apparently.
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: Argh!
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: briefly as in 1 sec, 2 sec, 10 sec, 0.1 sec?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] remains quietly present.
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: briefly as in between 1 and 2 seconds.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: odd.  what exactly do you do to make it do it/
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: each chat, it pauses for 1-2 sec?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has some old profiling code in there which has
decayed from disuse./ ~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; is in the building
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: it does not pause for every chat.
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: it pauses for many chats, but sometimes it pauses with
the &amp;amp;... prompt.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the pause with &amp;amp;... means you&amp;#39;re waiting for~doznec
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it really shouldn&amp;#39;t pin the cpu
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: Is there anything I can do from inside Arvo to help
diagnose this?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: not really at present, because profiling is not
live
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is surprising that &amp;amp;... would pin the cpu
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: or that something that happens then would pin
the cpu
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: because literally, &amp;amp;... is just the state of
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve said something to :room but haven&amp;#39;t heard anything back yet&amp;quot;
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: what are your feelings about ktrace,
atax3a?
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: It could just be false correlation on my part.
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot; can ktrace this, sure.  ~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; is in the
building
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot; is, in fact, ktracing. As we speak. And it just paused
before the &amp;quot;as&amp;quot;.
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: oh goodie
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: peculiar indeed
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I&amp;#39;ve never seen anything like this
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] suspects that hiddem&amp;#39;s computer has gone to pot.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: an expression first recorded in 1662, I&amp;#39;ll have
you know
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: It could be my machine - this is in a jail on ZFS,
which is a nonstandard configuration squared.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] wouldn&amp;#39;t be surprised if this is interacting
oddly with the checkpoint fsync
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it also could be the gc, which runs every 5
seconds whether we need it or not (we should never need it)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is still looking for that 28-byte leak, which
appeared mysteriously when satfex fixed all the other leaks
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: &amp;gt;_&amp;gt;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is sure that&amp;#39;s just a coincidence though.
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: hm. i&amp;#39;m not getting  filesync events either.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that bug sometimes pops up with non-ZFS
filesystems as well
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] does not entirely trust either libuv, or the
linux kernel, or his own code in this matter
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] can&amp;#39;t wait for a couple of interns to show up
this summer so he can send them into a greasy hole with vague instructions&amp;#39;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: like &amp;quot;go to system software hell and come back
with why I&amp;#39;m not getting my inotify events&amp;quot;
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: That&amp;#39;s not even vague.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: not as vague as it could be, but it assumes a
determination to do battle with whatever orcs may be encountered ~dilnem-nodfun
&amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; has left the building ~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] is in

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] goeth to lunch

Wolfe-Pauly] has left the building
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: testing 1 2 3 4 3 2 1?
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: yes, hi.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: hard to decouple network latency from vere latency~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it requires better toolage than we have~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] is in the building
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: So, if I send in ktrace.out files, would anyone be
able to read them? Or should I kdump them beforehand?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I&amp;#39;m anything but an experienced ktrace user...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: really the main question is whether you&amp;#39;re
spending your time inside nock or not
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you should be able to see this relatively
easily
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we are not instrumented to add urbit traces to
the ktrace trace ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is assuming that ktrace is something like
dtrace, which can thus be instrumented ~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] is in the
building
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: ktrace is more like strace - not an instrumentable
thing, just a syscall-boundary scanner.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: got it, but at least it tells you whether
you&amp;#39;re in user or kernel mode
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I assume
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: reminder, we have a chat meeting tomorrow nite
at 7pm PST
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Important Things will be discussed
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this has been your friendly local reinder
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: reminder
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: also, we have an IRL meetup next monday
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: in san francisco

~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; , astoundingly, should be able to make that, somehow.

tired of beautiful California winter weather ~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; has left the

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] just pushed an update to chapter 7
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: chapter 8 is coming sooner than you know...~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hang on, we got a page build failure
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Dr. Jekyll is Mr. Hyde all the time
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you will never ever catch me releasing a
product which tells you there&amp;#39;s a syntax error, BUT NOT WHICH LINE
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] &amp;#39;s idea of what Jekyll can do with itself are
graphic, profound and unprintable
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; once used a product whose config-parse error was &amp;quot;YOUR
JSON IS BAD AND YOU SHOULD FEEL BAD&amp;quot;.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]  has strong feelings about this whole era of
Wiffle Software
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that&amp;#39;s at least funny
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: I call it clownshoes garbage.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that&amp;#39;s good too
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Coffeescript is probably better than Jekyll but
I still feel the same way about it
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hint, if you can build Rome in a day, it&amp;#39;s
probably not a very good Rome
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] &amp;#39;s current feeling about the &amp;quot;Markdown family of
standards&amp;quot; revolves around the Todd Haynes film _Poison_
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a very arty late-80s homoerotic take on the
important sociopolitical issue of prison rap[e
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] doesn
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] doesn&amp;#39;t really see Markdown on the top in this
scene.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: tomsyt-balsen just discovered that the GFM
examples on Github&amp;#39;s own page don&amp;#39;t render properly.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the &amp;quot;M&amp;quot; in GFM stands for &amp;quot;Markdown,&amp;quot; it is
totally false that the &amp;quot;G&amp;quot; is for &amp;quot;Goats.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: actually the specific tool at fault here seems
to be something called Maruku
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which I think is an Albanian word for what you
do if you want to get married, but only have a goat.  ~rovrel-bicmyl has left
the building ~rovrel-bicmyl is in the building ~rovrel-bicmyl has left the
building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is still struggling with Markdown.  The goats
may be winning.
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: markdown is only mildly annoying
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: gh pages is a fscking nightmare
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: their parsing is sloppy as hell
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: but I&amp;#39;ve solved it, mostly
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and now i just feel dirty
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: okay, the latest and greatest chapter 7 is now
posdted
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: thanks to considerable effort from
tomsyt-balsen
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; likes the updates so far.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] prefers natural hoons to synthetic hoons.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: This seems a bit like classifying a book on Urbit into
a fiction/nonfiction axis.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ultimately it matters because the way you
really know hoon is to know ++ut, the compiler
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so the difference between synthetic/macro hoons
and ones that are implemented directly
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: is that you have to actually understand the
natural (direct) hoons, whereas you can just look the others up
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ++ut is less than 2kloc so it should be more or
less knowable...
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot; is admittedly scared of strings like
p.i.t.t.p.i.t.p.u.may
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this is what the alias feature is there to fix
~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot;: Also, I see that fink:ut and finq:ut have the same
sigfas. intentional?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ooh, just a sec
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes, there is actually no jet for finq - it
shouldn&amp;#39;t have a sigfas at all
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: I meant to asm
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: no I meant to ask, (freudian slip there)
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: is someone a _Total Annihilation_ player
~rovred-pilful &amp;quot;GREYFACE&amp;quot;: (&amp;quot;core&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;arm&amp;quot; were the names of the two factions
in that game.)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: heh, not at all
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a shared love for short words, I guess~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; is in the building ~hiddem-lomder &amp;quot;atax3a&amp;quot; has left the

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: :room stays up
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: if you can fix it by cloning chat.hoon, i&amp;#39;ll read
about it later :D
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; has left the building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: from the tweeters: &amp;lt;bascule&amp;gt; [32] Raft consensus
visualized:
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: &amp;lt;http://thesecretlivesofdata.com/raft/&amp;gt;
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Thank you for that site, ~hatteb-mitlyd.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Does raft encounter many long-term race conditions in
practice? Even in the toy example of network partitioning, it seemed to take a
long time to elect a leader.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; is unsure. e&amp;#39;s only ever encountered Raft in theory.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Test
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: %tost
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: doznec is a clingy neighbor
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: even Mr. Rogers only insisted approx. daily
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot; has left the building
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot; is in the building
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: freshly :reset, no problems
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: hey tasfyn, might i get push access to the doc repo
directly? or should i just push PRs?
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: :hi ~zod

~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot; is in the building
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; is in the building
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: is :update a thing i should expect to
work? because it&amp;#39;s telling me &amp;quot;main failed to merge&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;arvo failed to merge&amp;quot;
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;:update&amp;quot; should work, but is (iirc) known to be
&amp;quot;fragile&amp;quot;.  Not sure if that helps.  CGY or John B. should be consulted.
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: okay. well if i&amp;#39;m receiving chat messages
I will take that as a sign nothing is too broken and stop worrying.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: malmec-libsev, have you manually altered any of the
files in arvo or main? That caused merge failures for me as well.
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short] has left the building
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot; has left the building
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] is in the building
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: :update should work
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: unless you&amp;#39;ve made changes to your directory
tree
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: merging still pretty much sucks
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: figure out where the merge conflicts are and
just fix it manually
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: that should probably work
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; is in the building
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short] is in the building
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot; is in the building

~lapled-rammyn [Jordan Lewis] is in the building
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: :update is indeed fragile
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it awaits an OS cleanup pass, similar to what I
just did on hoon
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but documentation is coming first
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the right way to (try to) fix your merge
problems is to git pull, then cp -r from urb/zod
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; is in the building
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: Hail hail, there&amp;#39;s a new ~novrud-hanweb/try/ desk
again, I forgot to add the &amp;#39;?&amp;#39; doc
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: excellent
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I like that people are actually using the
filesystem...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: also btw, the current auction bid is 10BTC
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that one will probably stick I suspect...
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: :ls / ~novrud-hanweb/try/
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: oops
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: 
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: /try=/ or some other version
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: I think I asked this before but don&amp;#39;t recall seeing an
answer -- is anyone running their destroyer(s) on cloud based hosts?
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: Like amazon ecc etc.?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: actually I think most people are
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: interesting
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: certainly zod and doznec are on digital ocean
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: well, I don&amp;#39;t know about most people
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: i was for a bit but without web access to chat and the
command line it doesn&amp;#39;t have much advantage i found
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: and i&amp;#39;m not running a server that anyone else is
depending on
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: Is there a &amp;quot;howto&amp;quot; for folks who wanna try but don&amp;#39;t have
the time to figure out the details?
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short] has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: to run on amazon?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the directions on urbit.org should be
sufficient if you can get an instance going
~bitmet-racteg &amp;quot;IMT&amp;quot;: yeah, it&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;getting an instance going&amp;quot; part I
specifically wanted to avoid learning too much about.  :-)
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: getting a droplet on DO is maybe a 3 step
process
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: very easy
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: aws is somewhat more complicated
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short] is in the building
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: What&amp;#39;s the min-cost of a DO instance?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: $5 a month.  We&amp;#39;re paying 10 I think
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: Interesting.  Another question: I&amp;#39;ve got a couple of
beagleboards lying around, arm processors, run ubuntu.  Any reason why urbit
will obviously fail on a arm processor?
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: Also these look interesting: http://cubox-i.com/
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Urbit should be architecture-independent. I think some
intrepid souls have gotten it running on Mandroid devices.
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: That was my belief, but I thought it possible I was
missing something.
~labtud-machep [Steven Dee] is in the building
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: I like the idea of having a continuously running
instance, and I like the idea of a portable physical instance too, although I&amp;#39;m
not sure I can justify the latter.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the difficulty with urbit on low end machines
is that if they die, your ship loses continuity
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short] has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but labtud-machep over here is working on Raft
so you can have a cluster of them
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ideally a Beowulf cluster...
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; experiences unwelcome fasdot fasbcks.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there was a time when /.  didn&amp;#39;t suck, at least
not that much
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: OK. Yeah, as long as the media is extractable from the
&amp;quot;low end instance&amp;quot; I should be able to get the instance running again, right?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: maybe, maybe not - it depends on whether you
have committed everything before computing and responding to it
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: urbit is not terribly great at this at the
moment
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but then you don&amp;#39;t have any mission-critical
data in urbit I hope :-)
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: Sure.  but that could happen on any machine, right, given
a crash.
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: Not just yet.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; keeps all of its missions in Urbit.
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: I don&amp;#39;t even have a mission, for that matter.
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; has left the building
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: But I have plans.  No one knows my plan.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Oh dang I think I have to recreate the :thumb which
read a .plan from the thumbee.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it could.  but it is more likely to because our
present prototype doesn&amp;#39;t pay much attention to ACID
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; may be able to restore it from backups...
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: I unthinkingly blew away my $URBIT_HOME. How
thoughtless of me.
~labtud-machep [Steven Dee]: yeah I have a local Beowulf cluster going on my
portable laptop thin client terminal machine
~labtud-machep [Steven Dee]: it&amp;#39;s running all of Raft except the useful part
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: Beowulf cluster under vm&amp;#39;s running on your laptop, or do
you have LFB (Little Farm of Boards) of yer own?
~nimsup-losseb &amp;quot;DMT&amp;quot;: Raft, I know not.
~labtud-machep [Steven Dee]: actually not even VMs
~labtud-machep [Steven Dee]: well vere is a VM, right?
~labtud-machep [Steven Dee]: so I&amp;#39;m running a bunch of veres
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: vere is a real VM
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: as opposed to all of those fake ones that virtualize
x86_64 with hardware assistance
~labtud-machep [Steven Dee]: vere, putting the V in VM
~labtud-machep [Steven Dee]: VVM
~labtud-machep [Steven Dee]: the extra V stands for VYOVV
~bitmet-racteg &amp;quot;IMT&amp;quot;: Nice try, sonny, but it&amp;#39;s turtles all the way down.
~labtud-machep [Steven Dee]: until you get to the badgers
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: easiest way to distinguish rooms seems to be to use
tis to find residents.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: heh
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is distressed to think that all the cool kids
are over in yebyen&amp;#39;s room.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: at least he can post logs.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: i keep _almost_ forgetting that :room buffers
messages, so i can&amp;#39;t miss anything.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: unless the whole :room dies
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short] is in the building
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; is in the building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Is the w3c serious about letting the MPAA in?
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: The oldweb has this surreal parody aspect to it, more
often than not.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: why shouldn&amp;#39;t they be?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: exactly...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the oldweb was dead to me when popup blocking
in browsers just kind of stopped working.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; used to cry &amp;#39;death to the http monoculture&amp;#39;, and then
it got all Snowd&amp;#39;in.

~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: I&amp;#39;ve always been on this side of the breach...
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: updated and reset, I feel so
fresh

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] uses hand sanitizer as deodorant, it leaves him
feeling ineffably fresh
~wacdyr-ripwes is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: :ticket `@p`0xdddd.0100
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: doh
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Is C-w still flaky, tasfyn?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes :-)
~todnym-nathes has left the building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; avoids.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: who owns sarlug-picwep?  it seems to be
misbehaving...

~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; looks forward to it.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] looks sideways at it.
~wacdyr-ripwes has left the building
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short] is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: macmud added forward-word and backward-word
(M-F and M-B) to dill
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: that will help my middle-aged emacs fingers out a bit.
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: i was just missing those, myself
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] has left the building
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot; has left the building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: I&amp;#39;d read the article you linked, dash, but the URL
appears to say it all.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has left the building
~talmul-noswed has left the building
~macmud-taprut: huh, vere acts pretty funny if you switch the order of _lo_boot
and _lo_init
~macmud-taprut: (note, I don&amp;#39;t advise this)
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: funny ha-ha, or funny &amp;quot;there is a fish in my coffee&amp;quot;?
~macmud-taprut: the latter
~macmud-taprut: 2 cuil funny, you might say
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; has left the building
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: So I hear Urbit failed because
nobody has implemented strip poker in it within someone else&amp;#39;s time frame
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: where did you hear that?
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: oldwebz

~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: From the guy who&amp;#39;s partnered with
Stanislav to sell secure hardware
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Also, another writer I&amp;#39;ve never
heard of calls Urbit &amp;quot;the current epitome of the &amp;#39;toy boat startup&amp;#39;&amp;quot;
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: A definite compliment in that
context
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; had a friend lovingly say that Urbit could become the
next Smalltalk.
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: smalltalk wasn&amp;#39;t perfect but it was a
definite improvement on most of its successors
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: it&amp;#39;s a pity that the smalltalk implementation most of
us use is literally a child&amp;#39;s toy
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: made by Apple and Disney in a joint. venture.
~bitmet-racteg &amp;quot;IMT&amp;quot;: q:(slap !&amp;gt;(.) (rain ~ &amp;#39;(add 2 3)&amp;#39;))
~bitmet-racteg &amp;quot;IMT&amp;quot;: doh.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: insufficent hax
~bitmet-racteg &amp;quot;IMT&amp;quot;: No, twas not my intent to send the message &amp;quot;5&amp;quot; to

~bitmet-racteg &amp;quot;IMT&amp;quot; q:(slap !&amp;gt;(.) (rain ~ &amp;#39;(add 2 3)&amp;#39;)) 5

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I could be a toy boat startup, whee
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: everyone i know thinks Urbit is academic performance
art...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the &amp;quot;toy boat startup&amp;quot; guy is Paul Sawaya, I
think Burnham knows him
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that famo.us thing is cool too!
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] is in the building
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot; has left the building
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: hey guys, a funny thing happened on the
way to the :chat
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: when I searched for my ticket, gmail
asked me: &amp;quot;Did you mean: satfix-diddy&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: loves autocorrect
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] thinks urbit names need a canonical
pronunciation though
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: perhaps in a future continuity error
that&amp;#39;ll be my nickname
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: continuity era
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: :-|
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: S-Diddy?
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: S-diddy and the partyvan
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] thinks &amp;quot;tasfyn-partyv&amp;quot; needs to rhyme with
&amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s fine part hive&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: otherwise the ambiguous schwa rules all
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: actually name pronunciation merits some
less-un-serious thought at some point
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: indeed it does
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; just pronounces it with as neutral of an accent as &amp;#39;e
can manage.
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: one guy in particular was pretty curious
about it
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: one is always overly surprised to meet a
&amp;quot;cousin&amp;quot; differing by only one syllable
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but statistically this will be pretty darn
common
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: birthday effect and all that
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: your mind has to learn to disambiguate
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: as it already does with common English names
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Laura, Lauren.
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Any thoughts on timetable for
ACL&amp;#39;s, even as proof of concept? Or is the idea to delay Stallman&amp;#39;s nightmare
of the choice for data segregation as long as possible?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that needs to come in as part of our
forthcoming arvo design/cleanup pass
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it will probably still be preliminary but a
little smarter
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: obviously &amp;quot;everyone can read everyone else&amp;#39;s
files&amp;quot; is not an acceptable permanent solution
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] is not sure that &amp;quot;extant&amp;quot; is smarter than
the alternative
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: (like most of what I say, that was not
intentionally Zen)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: no, but it was intentionally confusing?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] did not recall saying &amp;quot;extant,&amp;quot; or even
&amp;quot;sextant...&amp;quot;
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: atax1a, you are lucky, I only know two people who even
half understand Urbit or care to try
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that&amp;#39;s an ideal position to be in - too cool
for school
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the basic problem is that the technology is
wildly overkill for the problem it can actually solve right now - ie, chat
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: the joke was that we currently don&amp;#39;t have
ACLs
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but once we get to the point where we start
killing other things
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: anterior cruciate ligament?
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: although I realize that we sort of do,
just not really
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is still confused
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: although, we do have ACLs in that you can only
get %cx from other ships
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: or %c*, rather
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but what you can&amp;#39;t do is go in and dereference
their private keys
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee] fears the day that urbit develops anterior
cruciate ligaments
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: unless they can get you to run their programs
over the network
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: be very afraid of yebyen&amp;#39;s little chat program,
he has that lean and hungry look
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] does not run other people&amp;#39;s programs on zod or
doznec, at least not until he has an anterior cruciate ligament.
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: yeah I only needed to change about 12 characters to
make my own channel
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: it would be smart to keep estimates on
time-to-sentience for various computer-related thingies
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Easier than making your own
Bitcoin clone
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: fortunately we can see the source, so we know
whether you stole our keys
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I&amp;#39;ll continue to publish my desk number
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: ship/desk/...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is just joking, really
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: i can&amp;#39;t remember what it&amp;#39;s called
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we&amp;#39;re all friends here.  until we&amp;#39;re not
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: imrowan, do you know I made bitcrapd?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you can use :label, btw, to actually give it a
label...
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Just to see what would happen the
other day I ran :pope and got actual output that looked like a non-error, of
course all the carrier names are already determined
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: before it was cool to make bitcoin clones
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I was not aware of that
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s one thing to run :pope, another to be the
pope...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]  finds the pope&amp;#39;s hat pretty heavy sometimes
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I really enjoy the feature of testnet coins, that if
nobody mines for so long... the difficulty goes back to minimum
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: it&amp;#39;s something like an uptime guarantee
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Heavy lies the head that wears
the hat
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;caught me?  have some free *coins to cover for me!&amp;quot;
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: yebyen, *g* is actually being
unhelpful. Colour me surprised.
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: what?
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I am so helpful :)
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I&amp;#39;m trying to not-name Sergey&amp;#39;s
Frankenstein, for the opposite reason that I usually type G-d
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: you mean Mr. Bitcoin Satosh
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I win! yay 
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: If I knew how to program I would
make the next Google-That-Does-Not-Suck
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: It would aggregate G* results
with everything else, then strip out the irrelevant spam that G* now provides
two and three of just to make you extra blood-pressury
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Like Dogpile, only actually
useful
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has left the building
~talmul-noswed has left the building
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I&amp;#39;m out gambling bitcoins again
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I might actually win enough to bid 10.3BTC on ~nyt
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: If anyone actually fires up their carrier, I kind of
imagine they would come to ~doznec to announce it
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: perhaps
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: Someone is going to do it
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: So you are the zenmaster, who went to Germany?
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: Greetings! :) \/ ~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan)
Rowan]: It would be interesting to budget a carrier, but I&amp;#39;m unable to comply
with the KYC requirement, and not in a moral or philosophical way. If I were
truly ack&amp;#39;d stateless I could probably \/ find a way like Mr. Gogulski did.  \/
\/
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: master? hardly, but I do recall being in
Germany recently
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I was very interested to find the nostate domain on
the PHP &amp;quot;bitcoin library&amp;quot; after someone petitioned me to help them
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: build a Bitcoin casino...
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: Has anyone seen his Bitcoin PHP library? :)
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: Mr. Gogulski
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: They insisted it should be in PHP and MySQL
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: we did not talk again after that day.
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I was only familar with him
through nostate, then one day I see he bought a carrier
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I had never heard of nostate until he bought a carrier
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: Is it his blog, or is he on it because he has no
state?
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: Incidentally, all of his backup documents were
inaccessible to my get requests
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I never saw his proof of not having any state
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: It sounded plausible, I think he probably has forfeit
his passport and had it returned with all the pages punched
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: But I thought it was odd that Urbit folk said &amp;quot;I
accept your documents&amp;quot; and each of his &amp;lt;img src had invalid attribs
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: And he&amp;#39;s not here now, so not able to defend himself
of course
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Heh, valid XML or GTFO
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I just tried myself, I can see
the docs when I click on the images
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: OK, I believe you
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I&amp;#39;m at a JuiceSSH terminal, I can&amp;#39;t check
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I win again!
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I am beyond words.

district, about as unlike a Greek monastery as one can imagine
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: cgy, I&amp;#39;m in America now!  I will probably be out in SF in
a couple weeks
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: hey, I have at times been known to walk
mindfully
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: walking mindfully in this area means watching
the pavement beneath your feet very closely
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: to me the urban Americans now appear as futuristic
catsuit-clad Jetsonoid robohumans
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that&amp;#39;s basically the state of things
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: if you don&amp;#39;t count the loping orcs and
shambling zombies
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: well I mean there&amp;#39;s the basic
poop-avoidance algorithm, but that doesn&amp;#39;t take that many cycles. you give it
say five out of every hundred moments and you&amp;#39;re good.
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: next to whom I am sort of like a homeless person
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: (which I technically am)
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: really walking mindfully takes way more
focus than that
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: any homeless person would scoff
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: where&amp;#39;s your cart?  where&amp;#39;s your needle
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: good questions
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: I have to go walk mindfully in the KS countryside now
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] thinks satfex is understanding the poop
avoidance problem
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] means underestimating it
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: for one thing, it&amp;#39;s not all a case of mounds.
There are also plenty of smears.
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: okay. honestly?  you&amp;#39;re never going to
avoid all of the poop. I&amp;#39;m sorry.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: dog vs. human is also a big concern
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but it&amp;#39;s true, DNA testing of the bottom of my
shoes would reveal...
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: in other news, this raft implementation
is giving me lots of ideas on how to not implement raft
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: at least it&amp;#39;s not Greece, which has terrible
problems with goat poop
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: looks like berries.  but, not berries.
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot; has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] would rather hear how not to implement raft.
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: look upon my github repo and despair
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that&amp;#39;s a very general complaint which probably
applies to all github repos
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: if we knew all, we would despair of all...
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; despairs of rather a lot, these days.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but not of the urbits hopefully!
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which are advancing at a great pace though it&amp;#39;s
not necessarily obvious
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Urbit is what keeps me afloat in my rivers of despair,
which may be a really sad thing for the outside world
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: i use urbit as a motivational device for
the new programmers i encounter on irc
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we can only create one small spot of order in a
permanently disordered world
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but we have no order yet, all we have is the
hope of order
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the promise of order
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but one of the premises of this entire
adventure is that order creates its own support
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: men and women instinctively loathe chaos and
crave order
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: even when they&amp;#39;ve been taught to love chaos and
fear order...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] thinks that a destroyer&amp;#39;s cruiser should be
known as its &amp;quot;mother.&amp;quot;  as in, mothership.
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: that is why i bought &amp;quot;greyface.org&amp;quot;

~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Is which thing on?
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: i&amp;#39;m typing through a child process
spawned by node.js
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: i think it works?
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: is it standard for the chat to not
automatically play back?
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: i think i&amp;#39;m also getting everyone&amp;#39;s
names three times in the list
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: It plays back what you missed.  If you just :begin&amp;#39;d a
destroyer, you missed everything.
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: hm. this is an old one.
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: seeing your comment twice too
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: restarting.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: you may be running two chats.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: or three.
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: ah yes
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: ^x
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly]: there we go
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; now pronounces (1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; x) as &amp;#39;bex x&amp;#39;. Truly, the
ursprache is taking over.

~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] has left the building
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: I walked.
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: pretty mindlessly, though.
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: hmm, the last time but one that I :began a destroyer,
:chat played me back EVERYTHING
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a lot of hilarity is due to the fact that I
thought I could build a message layer without a session identifier
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it works pretty much sort of
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is trying to document mindfully.  or perhaps
mindlessly.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: bex is one of those happy coincidences of
naming that&amp;#39;s just... right.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but they&amp;#39;re not all like that
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] still thinks (lte 5 6) should be no and (lte 6
5) should be yes
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: or maybe they should be curried?  but it would
be an enormous pita
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: to change
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: that is not a yak i would want to approach.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: many sherpas are killed by yaks every year
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you&amp;#39;d change it gradually, you&amp;#39;d create a new
arm that did it the new way
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and gradually shift users over to the new
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and then change the names back
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] does this kind of stuff all the time cuz he has
a language written in itself
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yall should see what it takes to change hoon in
hoon
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; hopes to see sometime.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you will, but it has already been substantially
domesticated
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: what it took to make the first hoon in hoon...
only I know and I don&amp;#39;t even remember
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: I heard it required some watt.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] changed to become more googleable.

~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i come bearing a functional curve25519
implementation
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: / ~tomsyt-balsen/try=/bin/curve/hoon
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: all bugs have been destroyed
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and it now actually does proper diffie-hellman
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i.e. actually key-compatible with djb&amp;#39;s
reference spec 
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: now to write aes and ed25519
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and we&amp;#39;ll have our cryptosuiteb
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: is it fast enough to run without a jet?
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: eh, not really, no
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: i mean you could
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: and it&amp;#39;d be about as fast as the RSA we have now
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: but why not use the jet?
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham]: it&amp;#39; free..
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] has left the building
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: just curious... since the underlying stuff
(muliplication, shifting) is already jetted

~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: wow, burnham
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: you get a piece of cheese for that
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: that&amp;#39;s about... 1/15 of my cheesespace
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: heh heh
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hopefully it&amp;#39;s goat cheese
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Interesting!
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: cheese comes in %goat %sheep and
                              %cow, but he can pick
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: I wish I&amp;#39;d brought some pieces of γίδα
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot;: pretty cool
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the ag department would probably confiscate
them
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] once brought a bunch of magic mushrooms back
from Japan in a jar full of miso
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: not among the smartest things he did in his 20s
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] doesn&amp;#39;t think the miso was very good for the
delicate chemicals anyway
~rigryx-sovrus &amp;quot;atax2a&amp;quot; did some pretty dumb things in the 20s.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hopefully the Kellogg-Briand pact wasn&amp;#39;t one of
them
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but I figured, who smuggles drugs in from
Japan?
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne] is in the building
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: an airport security drone in the UK really wanted to take
my cheese, but her boss wouldn&amp;#39;t let her
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: at that time you could actually buy them on the
street in Shibuya
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: some sense remains in the UK
~rigryx-sovrus &amp;quot;atax2a&amp;quot; smuggled cannabis out of Burning Man once. That was
pretty dumb.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: what
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: yeah, that was a mistake, 2
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: What, using sovrus, or doing the thing?
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; says, rhetorically.
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: that you had anything left to export
~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: The list of dumb things I did in my 20&amp;#39;s would
be lengthy.
~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: I&amp;#39;m pretty sure the statute of limitations
hasn&amp;#39;t expired on all of them.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: speaking of being in my 20s,
i&amp;#39;m gonna be in SF during the last week of february
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: I&amp;#39;ll be in SJC for a perfectly normal convention in
the middle of January
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] has left the building
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] welcomes hatteb and all visitors to Tlon&amp;#39;s
offices, which are literally a stone&amp;#39;s throw from *three* cannabis stores
~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: Q: what does one call an expression in Nock?
~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: Like *[1 2]
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you&amp;#39;d have to be a pretty good throw though...
~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: I&amp;#39;m calling it an expression, but didn&amp;#39;t know
if there wasn&amp;#39;t a non-standar name for it.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a formula.  well, the 2 is the formula.
*[subject formula]
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: formula, it&amp;#39;s not just for your howling
six-month-old
~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: Thanks!
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; is more interested in the Tlon than the herbary.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] once brought his three-day-old daughter to the
pediatrician only to be told, &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t worry, but she&amp;#39;s starving to death.  take
her home and give her some formula.&amp;quot;
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t worry but&amp;quot;
~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: There&amp;#39;s probably a better way to phrase that.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s actually quite normal for them to lose
10-15% of body weight in the first week
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: even if they don&amp;#39;t get into your
mushroom-flavored miso
~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: Still kind of alarming that it happens. 
~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: The weight loss, not the finding the shrooms.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: everything about the process is alarming.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: anything biological is
alarming
~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: And how.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: things that aren&amp;#39;t biological
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: are also often alarming
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short] has left the building
~talmul-noswed: &amp;quot;pop, my butt is itching.  can you give me cream?&amp;quot;

~talmul-noswed has left the building
~talmul-noswed is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is in the building
~talmul-noswed: and Boudreaux&amp;#39;s Butt Paste comes to the rescue.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: is that the real name of an
actual product
~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: Totally is.
~talmul-noswed: in fact it is
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: you&amp;#39;re not joking
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: he&amp;#39;s not joking
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: woah
~talmul-noswed: http://www.buttpaste.com/
~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: Now that&amp;#39;s alarming.
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: i am actually laughing irl
~talmul-noswed: rumors that I smuggled magic mushrooms back from Shibuya in a
jar of Butt Paste, however, are entirely unconfirmed.
~talmul-noswed: nosryl-tarpem has four kids, he probably has to train them to
put Butt Paste on each other
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: free-choice Butt Paste in a special tray
~talmul-noswed suspects that nosryl-tarpem has a staff of Oompa-Loompas
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hey wait, I turned into talmul-noswed
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] needs to keep a firmer grip on who he is today
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: how did that go wrong
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: two windows
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: four virtual desktops
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: oh
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: yeah
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: enough destroyers to sink the entire island of
Hawaii
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: Butt Paste fumes
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is going to have to check what happens when you
have a thousand destroyers in the same chatroom
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] suspects that it would only take about 80 to
bring ~doznec to its knees
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: what is the solution?  a bigger, taller doznec?  more
doznecs?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a more optimized doznec.  possibly with better
backoff on the pings.  and yes, bigger, taller
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: a cruiser simply has to be able to control 2^16
destroyers
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this is difficult with our poorly optimized
interpreted protocol path
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but the LLVM interpreter is making good
progress and we can always write a jet
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: 2^16 is a big number but not absolutely
terrifying
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: what is the first absolutely
terrifying power of 2
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: 1 ping a minute from 2^16 destroyers is 1000
pings/second
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you ought to be able to process a ping in a
millisecond, it aint doin that much
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: anything above 2^16 is terrifying :-)
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: ...  2^17
~labfes-larzod [aidan longworth (raptros) coyne]: hmm
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there is also a lot of latent capacity to
parallelize
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the ping should not have any side effects and
not need to be saveed, it&amp;#39;s just to keep the tunnel open
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: is a ping a card?
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: no, you just said
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is.  it becomes a packet which is a card
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: oh wait yes
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: but doesn&amp;#39;t need to be saved?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but if the card has no effect on the state, it
need not be saved
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: hmmm
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we can ignore the fact that it happened
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: simply compare the two nouns
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s perfectly legit.  unlike a jar of miso
stuffed with magic mushrooms.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which, fyi, don&amp;#39;t taste very good plain, and
even worse with miso
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: probably better than Butt Paste though.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: at least one is For Human Consumption
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] suspects that Butt Paste is probably not only
nontoxic, but might even be tasty
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] the other day handed his son a childproof bottle
of gummies and said, here, can you take the lid off?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: his intent was to show him that it&amp;#39;s impossible
to get into the vitamin gummies by himself.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] turned his back and in 3 seconds the lid was
off, hmm
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: speaking of which, has to go put his kids in
bed
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: good night everyone!  and welcome
foptec-nacfed...
~foptec-nacfed [Colin (Elision) Stanfill]: thanks!

briefly

~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: and ~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; has left the building
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I guess it&amp;#39;s messages from novrud-hanweb that don&amp;#39;t
make it to satnum-maptux
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: tasfyn-partyv: you still owe me -p
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I have a feeling that&amp;#39;s my issue, the restrictive
firewall here (and crappy nat there)
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: about the best thing i can suggest at the moment is to
:report on the ships in question...
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: and probably all the way up the routing hierarchy,
from the one that&amp;#39;s out of comms?
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: the worst expected behavior is that they both fall
back to talking through ~doznec, I think
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: packets (:hi&amp;#39;s) from ~novrud-hanweb just don&amp;#39;t make it
to ~satnum-maptux
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: one way comm in the other direction
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I&amp;#39;m going to disco/recon, against my better judgement

uses
~tomsyt-balsen [John Burnham] is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: naturally
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: issues
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I&amp;#39;m on a Starbucks connection, so surprised
that anything routes
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I did get a port in that magic range, which our
firewall is willing to route
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: So that might be the reason it&amp;#39;s working
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it might be but it shouldn&amp;#39;t be necessary
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we should always route through zod if needed
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: as for A1 security...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has always heard that these big books of
requirements were appalling and bureaucratic
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] would like to be A1 secure but more in the sense
of the steak sauce
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: mmm... steak
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: The spirit of A1 without the
letter might be nice

~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: we&amp;#39;re in ~novrud-hanweb discussing the subject
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: THE SUBJECT, the most significant mystery of all
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: and shorthand tree addressing
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: so if -&amp;lt; means &amp;quot;left child of subject&amp;quot;
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: what is the subject
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: I don&amp;#39;t even know anymore
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: no man
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: - means head
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: + means tail
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: &amp;lt; head &amp;gt; tail
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: so -&amp;lt; ought to mean tail of head
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: - is *a* subject
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: but in batz you can also say +
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: that&amp;#39;s the tail
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: the whole noun is .
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: oh boy you&amp;#39;re right
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: mercy, mercy, I can&amp;#39;t anymore, I&amp;#39;m leaving the other
:room
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: and I&amp;#39;m wrong
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: whew, only one &amp;amp;
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: yes, back to ~doznec
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: that&amp;#39;s worth like half a chicken right there
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: afaik !: enables tracing, but don&amp;#39;t quote
me...
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: sounds like a pragma
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: ee hee hee, . gives you the whole subject, - gives you
its head, + gives you its tail
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: s/subject/???/
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: and .&amp;lt; .&amp;gt; -&amp;lt; -&amp;gt; +&amp;lt; +&amp;gt; are all things... except for
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: it can&amp;#39;t be the whole subject of everything
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: because THE SUBJECT has to contain... arvo...  doesn&amp;#39;t
it?
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: no, the subject is different depending on what context
you&amp;#39;re in
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: +&amp;gt;
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: er whoops
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: neither .&amp;lt; or .&amp;gt; are valid things
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: yeah because -+&amp;lt;&amp;gt; operate on an implicit subject?
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: dot is like /1?
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: so +&amp;gt; is a core
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: tail of tail?
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I don&amp;#39;t understand why .&amp;lt; is not
                              - and .&amp;gt; is not +
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: I am going to take a stab in the dark and
say that it is the arvo core, but I expect to be totally off base
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: +&amp;gt;, that&amp;#39;s that horrible ugly thing
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: well i mean when you type it at
                %batz and get some stuff
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: however, my Hoon has not progressed much
in a while beyond basic math functions
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: in ., what are the sigs?
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: trying to write a math library made me YEARN for hoon
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: artifact of the print formats for @da and
@p... and @ta?
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I think sig is a null when it looks like that
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: all alone on its own line, in .
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: oh right
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: and yes, it&amp;#39;s part of the print format
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: so . is... [[date name] ugly]

~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: and &amp;lt;||&amp;gt;
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: yes
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: whatever the fark that is
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I have this sneaking suspicion that if I tell you the

~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: well I&amp;#39;m not going to try it then
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: due to lack of chicken, I went and started building

~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: huh, an assert failure, no less
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: then I tried killing vere and that resurrected me
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: we should be reporting those...

~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: but then in what sense is it a core
~satnum-maptux &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I still don&amp;#39;t really know what a core is
~satfex-difdyr [Steve Steve Dee Dee]: &amp;quot;core&amp;quot; may have not been the best of

~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: HOORAY
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] really is about to document this
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the problem with the app subject is that it&amp;#39;s a
relatively mature application framework
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: so then =&amp;gt;  .(-&amp;lt; `who=@p`-&amp;lt;) means use -&amp;lt; as the subject
for that other thing
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and has a whole lot of funky stuff that various
applications would mean
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: arg
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: I would like SO MUCH to see that subject all diagrammed
out
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: inasmuch as it were able
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it means, take the subject and replace `-&amp;lt;`,
ie, nock /4, with nock /4 cast to `who=@p`
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: sweet
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: that&amp;#39;s different from `@p` because... I&amp;#39;m sure extant
hoon doc mentions this
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so the subject you start an application with is
[[identity application-path] library-stack]
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but we don&amp;#39;t give them names, because that
seems like cheating
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: why?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: suppose you don&amp;#39;t speak English?  well, it may
be too nitpicky
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: oh right
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: well okay, they have essences and fixed locations, that&amp;#39;s
better than a name
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] tries not to bind variable names automagically
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes, they do, -&amp;lt; at that level will never
change
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: identity is *my* identity?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the program has to know (a) where it is run
from, (b) who is running it
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this is the basics of configuration, a config
file can replace this with something more complex
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there is a whole funky configuration loading
path which hasn&amp;#39;t been used at all yet
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but will eventually be needed at the OS level
for complex apps
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: which need, of course, config files
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: you can&amp;#39;t just store config in a variable?
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: sorry I disappeared
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: your configuration may and will be a single
noun, ie, - at the top of the file as it were
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this noun may be arbitrarily complex, it may
contain one label or several
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so, as a way of providing a kind of &amp;quot;default
configuration,&amp;quot; we provide
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: oh, to source parts of it from different places...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the simple pair of [identity application-path],
with no labels
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you may want cascading configurations for
bundles of apps, etc
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: application-path is a filesystem path?
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: what am I saying.  global immutable namespace path!
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes it is.  it&amp;#39;s okay to say filesystem... I
say it myself...

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: what&amp;#39;s the last line?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the last line is the most significant
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the top of the stack
~roppec-sampyx &amp;quot;Lysergic Spooner&amp;quot;: Last line before the exit: !  /~roppec-sampyx/arvo/ ~2014.1.10..17.22.41..5f8c/batz/:&amp;lt;[351 15].[351 47]&amp;gt;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: agh, that&amp;#39;s yet another case of &amp;quot;the thread was

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: some listener was not properly cancelled
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: batz is due for a big rewrite that should
eliminate all these problems
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but doc takes the priority
~roppec-sampyx &amp;quot;Lysergic Spooner&amp;quot;: *nods*

water

was sent to it anywas&amp;quot; errors. %work has those in spades.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: batz actually has a very solid causal mechanism
for deregistering listeners when a thread/task goes away
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Speaking of, I should have some free time on~2014.1.20 to visit Tlon HQ.

day...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] seconds the suggestion, after all, THAT&amp;#39;S WHAT

~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; remembers them working better than both revision

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: urbit is nothing but urban.

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] does think of Steve as hobmed
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we do need a one-face policy in the long run
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: or the medium run
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: when we get over needing lots of spare

destroyer for :chat?  You know, unless you have a good reason.&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that&amp;#39;s exactly how :-)
~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: Brilliant.
~nosryl-tarpem [Justin LeBlanc]: Probably won&amp;#39;t scale very well as a policy,
but probably scales better than I would think.

~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: if an application&amp;#39;s subject is [[identity

~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: then what&amp;#39;s batz&amp;#39;s subject?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: at the kernel level?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: batz itself is a vane
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: batz itself is a vane and starts with simply
the hoon.hoon kernel stack
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: no state
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: then it pushes its own state on top of it
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: [batz-state kernel-stack]
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you can see it in batz.hoon if you look at
&amp;quot;section 4bC, shell vane&amp;quot;
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: oh!  that&amp;#39;s why . at the prompt gets you something like
[[identity date] ugly]
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: oh I see what you mean
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: no, that is the subject batz gives to
expressions on the command line
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: that&amp;#39;s what I wanted to ask
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: totally different from the application subject
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that one is created in ++food at line 1084
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is lookin at it now
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] warns the audience that it will probably change
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we throw in: the time as a time, the time as a
text span, your name as a @p, your name as a text span,
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the results of previous computations,
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: that&amp;#39;s &amp;lt;||&amp;gt;?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the variable state (that&amp;#39;s why =foo %bar works)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes, not sure the &amp;lt;||&amp;gt; is operating quite
correctly
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but basically, the idea is - stuff you need in
a command
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: all this will probably be changed a little bit
when we do our combined arvo doc/cleanup pass
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the goal with what&amp;#39;s there was to get a stab at
it
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but you can see why it&amp;#39;s different from the
application subject
~racbes-solmun &amp;quot;kpm&amp;quot;: so the tail of . is the variable state?  the salad in &amp;lt;&amp;gt;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that&amp;#39;s exactly right
~talsur-todres [Galen (galen) Wolfe-Pauly] has left the building
~midlys-rocpet [John Burnham] is in the building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; is bemused by the @p and @da having text-span versions.
Almost like you did that to break the runes someone came up with, and force
them to use names. :)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Urbit works now. For some values of “work.” To be exact, it’s a pretty decent replacement for IRC. And since it’s a pretty decent replacement for IRC, and bored geeks are what they are, we use it as a replacement for IRC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike IRC, the Urbit chat server (:room) logs everything. We thought we’d turn this vice into a virtue and start posting our daily chat logs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado: Urbit, &lt;code&gt;~2014.1.6&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is happy to announce that (his private branch
                of) Hoon is now frozen
~ligfed-famsef &amp;quot;γίδα βραστή&amp;quot;: hooray!
~ligfed-famsef &amp;quot;γίδα βραστή&amp;quot;: what temperature?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: 164 I think
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: still working on the version numbers
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we will then have, sigh, another continuity
                breach...
~sivbud-barnel [Bruce Schwartz] is in the building
~nibweg-sivnex is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: sivbud, is this hoon stuff making more sense
                to you?
~patsec-rigreb [Benedikt Gerhard (Hanfer) Kleiner] is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: welcome patsec-rigreb
~patsec-rigreb [Benedikt Gerhard (Hanfer) Kleiner]: Hi
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we will have a continuity breach (reboot the
                world) soon, don&amp;#39;t worry it&amp;#39;s not something we do often :-)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] strongly recommends working through the Nock
                doc for all new users
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and old users as well
~patsec-rigreb [Benedikt Gerhard (Hanfer) Kleiner]: i just started .... im
                about to read the nock part...
~ligfed-famsef &amp;quot;γίδα βραστή&amp;quot;: if I were writing Nock doc for five-year-olds,
                it would have a lot of explosions
~ligfed-famsef &amp;quot;γίδα βραστή&amp;quot;: somehow it just feels like the formula is...
                *detonating* the subject
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ideally they would be animated with lots of
                noise as well
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has a five-year-old girl for which this
                treatment may not be ideal
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] needs to find a way to make the subject be a
                princess.
~ligfed-famsef &amp;quot;γίδα βραστή&amp;quot;: we&amp;#39;ll have an explosions version and a
                princesses version
~ligfed-famsef &amp;quot;γίδα βραστή&amp;quot;: and an explosions-and-princesses version for
                %punks
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] &amp;#39;s daughter might go for the
                explosions-and-princesses
~patsec-rigreb [Benedikt Gerhard (Hanfer) Kleiner]: i might go for the
                explosions-and-princesses version :D
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: no princesses can explode, that would scare
                her
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: they would have to be very sparkly
                explosions...
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: hello martians
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: good morning malmec-libsev
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: are you surprised that this just works?
~nibweg-sivnex has left the building
~sivbud-barnel [Bruce Schwartz] has left the building
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: I understand now what you meant by
                building an identity abstraction layer being like zoo 
                design, I think. Identities aren&amp;#39;t commensurable across 
                systems. Urbit ships, email addresses, ssh keys, and 
                passports all express different concepts that can&amp;#39;t
                be abstracted away.
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: I am less surprised that this works
                than, say, XMPP working.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it still surprises me if XMPP works :-)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] forgets whether Google has federation turned
                on or turned off at the moment
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: I worked on a SIP-based VoIP stack a
                few years ago. My metric for surprise has been calibrated a
                little differently ever since.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but yes, it&amp;#39;s very difficult to imagine any
                kind of app that treats~tasfyn-partyv and curtis@tlon.io as
                instances of the same thing
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: was SIP ever really a functioning standard?
                I mean, if your stack spoke SIP and mine did too, did that 
                just mean we could chat?
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: Yes! If there was no NAT involved. :)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: did SIP for instance have a standard
                required codec that everyone could fall back to?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: urbit will actually do TURN, effectively, if
                your NAT is too sucky
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: all the packets will be forwarded through
                ~zod
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: well, SIP was just signalling, it
                didn&amp;#39;t handle media. RTP was the media stream, and I don&amp;#39;t 
                think there was a required codec.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but this only happens if &amp;quot;bad NAT&amp;quot; is
                talking to &amp;quot;bad NAT&amp;quot; - then there&amp;#39;s no way around TURN.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I do know this about SIP
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the separation of media and streaming into
                two protocol categories - both of which have to work if you
                want to talk -
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: is good IETF politics, but that&amp;#39;s about it
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: Right. Some bad NATs will work if you
                can get both sides to start talking to each other 
                simultaneously. But that&amp;#39;s sort of a fine shade of 
                difference
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: because it will reuse the same port anyway?
                yicks.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we haven&amp;#39;t had any apparent NAT problems on
                urbit for a little while, knock on wood
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: here, I&amp;#39;ll use private messaging to send you
                a packet directly...
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: yeah. as a result of our experience
                with that, we started on a generalized NAT-holepunching 
                library (after noticing it was impossible to send a file 
                over the internet), but ran out of time and money.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ha, I spoke too soon, my client is still
                trying to punch a hole to you
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: anyway SIP was the only thing that did
                that AFAIK. H.323 and IAX both had in-band signalling
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: oh, now I see &amp;quot;&amp;lt; doznec:&amp;quot;
~patsec-rigreb [Benedikt Gerhard (Hanfer) Kleiner] has left the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ah, now my communication reached you
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: yep
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we are neighbors, we&amp;#39;ve exchagned keys
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: nice.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: have to figure out why it took so long
                though
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: for one thing, my congestion control is
                utter sh*t
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but in any case, the whole effort at
                producing IETF standards was really doomed
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: what do people use to talk on the internets
                today?  proprietary clients
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: well, supposedly the separation meant
                you could do things like third-party call control, where the
                signalling went through a controller host but the media 
                stream went between clients directly
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: why?  basically in my book because IP
                chickened out on the identity problem
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that&amp;#39;s a case of features pursuing a problem
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: or more precisely, that&amp;#39;s a case of people
                who sell legacy PBXes imposing their requirements on an 
                internet standard
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: SIP is still used in VoIP desk phones,
                and I think that was the original use case
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]  hasn&amp;#39;t seen a desk phone, VoIP or otherwise,
                in a while
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the new cool-kid companies don&amp;#39;t have
                internal phone systems at all...
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: yeah. Generals fighting the last war.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you just can&amp;#39;t deploy a new standard on the
                internets these days, in any case
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]  is really not even quite sure why IETF still
                exists.
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: well, it&amp;#39;s nice to still have a
                standards body that isn&amp;#39;t the W3C
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: (as a reminder of how things could have
                gone)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]  is also not sure why the W3C exists :-)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there was real greatness in the IETF, but
                not as much as there could have been
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the whole DNA of IP networking incorporates
                the assumption that basically it&amp;#39;s a network of trusted 
                parties, way too deeply
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: if you expose a new service it will simply
                get spammed to death
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the only reason we have port 25 is that
                email existed before spam, so it was worth saving
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: yeah.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so, that&amp;#39;s basically why we&amp;#39;re shipping a
                new layer, not a new service on the old layer.
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: sure. I think my tolerance for
                compatibility with old crap is greater than yours; perhaps 
                as much greater
                as your tolerance for engineering compromise is over 
                Stanislav&amp;#39;s. :)
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: A complementary approach to the spam
                problem, I think, is to build services that can function 
                with bounded levels of trust --
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there are different ways of doing
                compatibility with old crap
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: your ship, for instance, is actually a
                pretty decent HTTP server...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the basic principle is that the old crap can
                depend on us, but we can&amp;#39;t depend on the old crap
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: Right, I do remember that part. Makes
                sense.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: also, the minimum level of trust is
                essentially the knowledge that an identity is a unique or at 
                least identifiable individual
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: or at least, a *finite* individual in some
                sense.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you really can&amp;#39;t do anything with an
                infinite-identity system.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: IPv4 addresses come really close to being an
                excellent finite-identity system, but they are too wrapped up 
                in routing topology.
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: For some values of anything. There are
                still things that make sense as coin-operated services, I think
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: then you have the knowledge that someone has
                paid a coin - again, finite in some sense.
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: Right. But not strongly tied to
                identity.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: right.  but you know what identity paid a
                coin.  so even in an infinite space, it enters the subspace of 
                coin-paying identities.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but it&amp;#39;s moot, as IPv4 never established a
                payment model either.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: easy to imagine what the Internet would have
                been if BTC had been part of it from the beginning :-)
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: Sure. It&amp;#39;s almost moot to talk about IP
                these days; the set of hosts you can exchange IP packets with 
                is much smaller than the set you can establish a TCP (or HTTP!)
                connection with
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes.  this is all part of the general
                pattern of &amp;quot;use the internets as a modem.&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is a fairly good modem... but...
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: Bryan Ford and friends have been
                thinking about how to cope with this: 
                http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/2009/tng/
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: well, that&amp;#39;s a nice publication.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: good luck with your chicken-and-egg
                problem...
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: heh yes
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you can always publish something in the
                &amp;quot;Journal of Herculean Solutions to Problems Everyone Stopped 
                Trying To Fix Many Years Ago&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this is why I left academic CS, they are
                always making up problems which sound real but aren&amp;#39;t, then 
                solving them
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I am now capable of skimming a paper in 30
                seconds and finding the unrealistic assumption which makes the
                problem interesting
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: Certainly. Worse, when they do find a
                real problem, it still has to be couched in the same language 
                and format
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: in this case that would be, &amp;quot;we can get
                everyone to install flow boxes for our new transport protocol 
                in their DMZs&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this is what I call the &amp;quot;City Lights
                problem&amp;quot;
~sivbud-barnel [Bruce Schwartz] is in the building
~nibweg-sivnex is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you can see it if you go upstairs to the
                poetry room at City Lights bookstore in SF
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: As a fan of Ferlinghetti, I
                approve this analogy
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: on the walls are probably about 7,000 works
                of modern poetry, perhaps 20 or 30 of which are worth reading
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but they all look the same on the outside...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Ferlinghetti had it easy, he did his thing
                before the legion of Ferlinghetti imitators arrived
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: well, the stuff they were working on is
                getting new transport protocols to fit through old ones, as I
                understand it
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: since installing new boxes is
                infeasible
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I admit imitating him
                shamelessly in grade school
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: the argument basically being &amp;quot;TCP is
                the new bottom layer of the interwebz&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: when something is too easy to imitate,
                social cues determine who succeeds
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I take exception to this, I do believe UDP
                can be made to work
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but your home isn&amp;#39;t really part of the
                interwebz, still less your cell phone
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: If only the new documentary on
                him didn&amp;#39;t suck (I don&amp;#39;t know, I just assume it will)
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: I would like UDP to work. But as you
                say, it&amp;#39;s hard to get into your home and harder to get into 
                your cellphone
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Isn&amp;#39;t that just as much due to
                widespread natting?
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Which UDP seems to punch
                through with less issue
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: On a first-world home internet
                connection yes.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: exactly, but not even on a cellphone
                internet connection
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: these are typically not full-cone AFAIK
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but on a cellphone, you should only be
                talking to your ship in the cloud
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Intriguing (I had to look up
                full cone)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and running your urbit ship at home is only
                for those who truly fear the NSA/CIA/FBI etc
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I&amp;#39;d feel safer running an
                Urbit ship on a cloud VPS than I would a Linux distro
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I would too, but I don&amp;#39;t fear the NSA
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: *to clarify, &amp;quot;than I would
                running a Linux distro on a cloud VPS&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I fear machine outages - nb, we are putting
                Raft in the event logging system to create a genuinely 
                reliable server
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: I fear the NSA less than the
                local cops, and data loss on a par with anything that threatens
                my physical safety
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Raft? Another
                Stephenson-inspired naming?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this is Ousterhout&amp;#39;s replacement for Paxos
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: don&amp;#39;t know the origin of the name...
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Wow (reading RAFT)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: once zod/doznec are protected by this, and
                we have conquered the continuity issues, dataz will never be 
                lost
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] now feels reasonably confident he could
                change the type of type type, without losing continuity
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: continuity breach warning is flashing RED
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Happy New Year!  And welcome to Hoon 164.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Hoon is now frozen for the reasonably
                short-term future.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: More documentation is coming soon...
~roppec-sampyx &amp;quot;Lysergic Spooner&amp;quot; is in the building
~roppec-sampyx &amp;quot;Lysergic Spooner&amp;quot;: Apparently I am immortal, having proven I
                have no life
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan] is in the building
~difryt-dapdeg [Ian Michael (imrowan) Rowan]: Yep, that&amp;#39;s the shortest chat
                backlog I&amp;#39;ve seen yet *g*
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has left the building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes we seem to exist again, gentlemen
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I always worry that the breach instructions
                are not as accessible as they should be
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: with a significantly cooler hoon. :D
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes it is, better wear at least some
                underwear before you go outside at 164
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: always nice to see the core group show up
                when we reboot the world
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; just happens to procrastinate on going to sleep every
                time you do that :)
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: well, we are well-versed in the ritual of the
                continuity breach.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: fortunately it&amp;#39;s a ritual that is becoming
                rarer and rarer
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but my concern is for those with weaker
                attachment
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: I was expecting doznec to be herd-thundered into
                unresponsiveness in those first minutes, but go figure
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: one thing we&amp;#39;re going to do is put a live
                chat window on urbit.org, output only...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: none of us was chatting much over the
                christmas break, it helped keep the numbers down
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; can only imagine what it&amp;#39;s like to breach continuity
                on~zod. &amp;quot;It must be one step hairier than doing~doznec, eh?&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: no, it&amp;#39;s really very simple, you just run
                with -c.
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: make an RSS feed of that chat window, while at it
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I think I&amp;#39;ll also start posting regular
                dumps to the urbit blog.
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: ...or that, yeah
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: including only %white discourse, of course.
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: still, I picked the right time to go %punk
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I really want to eventually enforce a
                one-face rule on people
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so that the shipname gets remembered better
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this will be easier when sh*t isn&amp;#39;t
                constantly breaking
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: one-face as in once chatty ship per person or same
                name on all ships the person is using to chat?
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: s/once/one/
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: one chatty ship per person.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: enforced only with weak social pressure.
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: and how would you enforce that?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hardly at all.  well, new users get only one
                destroyer.
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: gah, you type faster than I think
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the point is to have one ship, one user be
                normal
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: of course not everyone has to be normal.
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: so yachts don&amp;#39;t get to chat?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: certainly not directly.
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: ah
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: there are only 2^32 reputations.  so even if
                :room accepted messages from a yacht they&amp;#39;d be listed under 
                its destroyer.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; understands yachts to be pleasure vessels.
                Destroyers are... something else entirely.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: don&amp;#39;t sail away with the metaphor!
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yachts are client ids.  destroyers are
                servers.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: actually I think we&amp;#39;ll change it to &amp;quot;yawls.&amp;quot;
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: destruction can bring pleasure!  as can cruising and
                carrying, of course
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so, for instance, a yacht is tied to a
                browser persona via cookies
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: well, you can pack a yawl with explosives.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; is suitably re-metaphored.
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: explosive cookies
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] has no actual plans to do jihad.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; snickers.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] explains that &amp;quot;Urbit is the greater jihad.&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] exhorts all jihadis to cancel their
                pressure-cooker orders and learn Nock.
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: oh, the proper term is &amp;quot;pop rocks&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] used to smuggle pop rocks into Singapore,
                double-sealed in a rectal condom.
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot; &amp;#39;m mind is now hung, trying to decide whether &amp;quot;rectal&amp;quot;
                refers to type of product, placement thereof, or both
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but one day the latex broke and... let&amp;#39;s
                just say it was embarrassing.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: so he became a programmer instead.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] was just thinking of
                http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah_Hassan_Al_Aseery.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: an old buddy of mine, Abdul, he should have
                stuck with the pop rocks
~dilnem-nodfun &amp;quot;cmm&amp;quot;: who knows perhaps he did.  amount matters
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: well, it&amp;#39;s a fact that Prince Nayef wasn&amp;#39;t
                that badly injured...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] imagines missions deep into the secret heart
                of Yemen, convincing the local explosives engineers that pop 
                rocks are really PETN
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: in other news, does anyone know why lldb on
                Mavericks thinks all my corefiles are corrupt?
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: not offhand
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: error: core.88781 is a corrupt mach-o file:
                load command 440 LC_SEGMENT_64 has a fileoff + filesize 
                (0x5a438000) that extends beyond the end of the file 
                (0x5a437000), the segment will be truncated
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it could be the result of our mmap abuse,
                perhaps...
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short] is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: any difficulty with the continuity breach,
                malmec?
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: there was a slight hiccup i think?
                after :begin, I got &amp;quot;request approved&amp;quot;, a... martian file 
                listing, i guess,
                then a &amp;quot;save: gc:&amp;quot; line, then it stopped at &amp;quot;waiting&amp;quot; until 
                I hit ^D
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: but then i got the usual try prompt
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; remembers that bug being around for a while, but
                isn&amp;#39;t sure what to do to fix it.

~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; has a copy of that in a &amp;quot;recently read&amp;quot; stack. If I
                wanted to be completely derivative, I could ape his style...
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: after reading
                http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/mickens/
                thisworldofours.pdf I started to get suspicious
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: &amp;#39;I’ll look at the abstract for the
                talk, and it will say something like this: “It is well-known 
                that five-way secret sharing has been illegal since the

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: malmec, your update was slow because our
                network only gets about 20k/s
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Interestingly, a mobile phone

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] would probably be appalled if he ever had a

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: at least I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s turing complete,

                well-functioning computers?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ideally we&amp;#39;ll use our well-functioning
                computers to create great new works of funny
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: And now we must calculate the discount ratio of
                future humor to see if its worth the costs.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: This sounds complicated to do deductively, however
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: ,so perhaps we should set up a &amp;quot;Future Human Humor
                Production&amp;quot; betting market.

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hey Apple, basic toolchain principles:
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: (1) -g always has the same result as -O, and
                vice versa.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: (2) the program always does the same thing
                in the debugger as plain.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] feels this LLVM gcc toolchain is not ready
                for prime time.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes, the repeated key exchange thing is
                definitely a problem
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: apart from anything, it effectively leaks
                memory

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I will fix this.  but, I have to fix the

                I already fixed this bug and git lost my change.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but then, I looked at the fix location and
                the fix seems to be there.  so...
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: doznec just became my neighbor again.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s a little too neighborly for my taste
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I mean give it a rest, doznec...
~divsem-misdef &amp;quot;xulrunner42&amp;quot;: at least he doesn&amp;#39;t stomp on your ceiling like

~divsem-misdef &amp;quot;xulrunner42&amp;quot;: every time i hear their baby cry I think the
                sound that comes after must be the baby getting dropkicked
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: oh. yes I got 23 &amp;quot;~doznec is your

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes, that&amp;#39;s 23 key exchanges, decidedly
                suboptimal
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] is sure he did something to break that...

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s the same thing I think, I just deleted
                the route timeout message

~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: last time i worked with a udp-based

~divsem-misdef &amp;quot;xulrunner42&amp;quot; has left the building
~malmec-libsev [Allen (dash) Short]: I have to wonder how well congestion

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: don&amp;#39;t know CCNx&amp;#39;s congestion control
                problem, but I know it&amp;#39;s more focused on multicast
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that seems harder...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: as for reimplementing TCP, there are of
                course several TCP algs to choose from
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we have the additional complication that our
                acks are end-to-end
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the ack is sent only after the packet is
                fully processed and committed
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is the same congestion control problem,
                but with a lot more variance because the internal round trip 
                is treated as part of the pathway
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but also, I just winged it with something
                crude that works
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: certainly not the way to get good CC

                there&amp;#39;s always the congestion-control algorithm from

~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: yes I considered that one as well, though it
                prioritizes against interactive traffic
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s really the perfect project for a bright
                intern to spend a week on

~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Two weeks, if one didn&amp;#39;t know Hoon that well.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: we&amp;#39;ll develop a Matrix style chip for
                learning Hoon.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: like doc but better...
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; would settle for doc.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: I also have a friend who did a Chicago
                implementation.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; knows we&amp;#39;re partial to raving with dj djb here...
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Chicago implementation?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Chicago implementation?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] wants to know if that&amp;#39;s a euphemism.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Dan Bernstein, perhaps.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: aka djb.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I know that part.  But not the Chicago.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: He&amp;#39;s at the University of Illinois at Chicago, but I
                don&amp;#39;t know what exactly is being implemented...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] somehow assumed it was UIUC.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Chicago, the congestion control algorithm specified
                somewhere around CurveCP. :)
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: From Wikipedia: &amp;quot;Bernstein explained, in 2005, that
                he is pursuing a strategy to &amp;quot;produce invulnerable computer 
                systems&amp;quot;. He plans to achieve this by putting the vast majority
                of computer software into an &amp;quot;extreme sandbox&amp;quot; that only allows
                it to transform input into output.&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: ah.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: Urbit is a sort of extreme sandbox...
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: http://curvecp.org/decongestion.html
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Thank you, atax1a.
~divsem-misdef &amp;quot;xulrunner42&amp;quot; has left the building
~divsem-misdef &amp;quot;xulrunner42&amp;quot; is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin] will take a look.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: looks pretty reasonable, like most of the
                djb stuff
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; goes to read through the new, cooler, hoon.hoon.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the changes are all subtle... but...
~divsem-misdef &amp;quot;xulrunner42&amp;quot; has left the building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: any HEADSUP for the experienced reader?
~divsem-misdef &amp;quot;xulrunner42&amp;quot; is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hoons are now divided into twigs and tiles -
                this division used to be very unclear
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I guess that was in the previous checkin,
                but...
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: in this one we have aliases, =*
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you can bind an alias as you pattern-match
                it
~monder-navryx &amp;quot;LarryH&amp;quot; is in the building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: How would i use tistar?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: if you say &amp;quot;=*  a  b&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it&amp;#39;s like &amp;quot;=+  a  b&amp;quot;
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: except that b has to be a wing (resolve to
                an axis, not a computed expression)
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and the subject noun is unchanged
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: also, when you pattern-match on your alias a
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: what you learn about an alias stays on the
                alias
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: this eliminates a common problem where you
                know a type in too much detail
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and can&amp;#39;t for example bind something more
                general back into it
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: that clarifies matters a bit more.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; still doesn&amp;#39;t quite grok /===/try/app/hoon, except
                in broad strokes. At last check, fapp in batz launched an app 
                from the filesystem.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it does that...
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: the app... tisgar centis dot lus tisgar lus...
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;given the current subject, tack this core on&amp;quot;?
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;and invoke&amp;quot;??
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: you&amp;#39;re deep in the heart of the funk my man
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; cannot tell if that&amp;#39;s a good thing.
~divsem-misdef &amp;quot;xulrunner42&amp;quot;: gotta have that funk!
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it is a good thing.  but, it is probably not
                the best use of my time to explain ++fapp at the moment.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: sur.
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; is in the building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: +e.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hey, can everyone do a :reset?
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: now? no :update?
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: just :reset, no :update?
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I am starting to suspect that some old code
                slipped in to the last urbit.pill.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: an :update can&amp;#39;t hurt.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but what I notice is that when I start
                reloading to find the bugs, the bugs go away.

~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; got a %clay update and successfully reset.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: it certainly can&amp;#39;t hurt yo.
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: my computer is not as fast
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: got the same update on divsem-misdef, still doing
                :reset
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: what the %duce
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: sorry about that %duce
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: doznec is going up and down, update again
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: the duce will be gone
~hidsup-donsyn &amp;quot;UWTB&amp;quot; is in the building

~roppec-sampyx &amp;quot;Lysergic Spooner&amp;quot;: Huh, this destroyer got the char restart
                on its own, the other was still trying. I update and reset this
                one and got it back already, the other&amp;#39;s still [waiting...] on 
                the :update.
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: Updated, reloaded %clay.
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: still waiting on that update?  who&amp;#39;s
                waiting?
~roppec-sampyx &amp;quot;Lysergic Spooner&amp;quot;: waiting is~difryt-dapdeg
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hang on ....
~sarlug-picwep &amp;quot;ikari&amp;quot;: Not on the :update, but~fantyv-ralpen is waiting
                for~doznec.
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: it worked here,~divsem-misdef is still doing
                :reset but it did get the update, second time I tried
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hm... I see some unacknowledged messages...
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: first time it was just hanging having a hard time
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: tell you what - I have to go and pick up my
                kids
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: did you kill it, yebyen?
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: ^D
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: tried again, worked, should be back any second
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: hm, I do prefer not working around things
                that are working badly...
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: at %vane %e
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: report the crime, don&amp;#39;t solve the crime
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: but I encourage everyone with a waiting
                destroyer to leave it waiting for right now
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: and if it keeps waiting, the drydock is the
                place for it...
~divsem-misdef &amp;quot;xulrunner42&amp;quot; is in the building
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: possible that doznec lost some events in my
                power cycle, though I kind of doubt it
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: sorry I didn&amp;#39;t save it for you, this device is an
                android tegra3
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: so it was pretty slow
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: I can use a pier from an android tegra3,
                it&amp;#39;s all the same pier man
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: i thought it might just be slowness or intermittent
                network issue
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: that is possible as well...
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: i&amp;#39;m sure you could use it
~tasfyn-partyv [Curtis Yarvin]: anyway, catch you guys later...
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: cheers!
~sarlug-picwep &amp;quot;ikari&amp;quot;: Vale.
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I noticed some weirdness with the ! quit the other
                day before the breach
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: i never tried ! to quit before, but it didn&amp;#39;t quit

~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot; is in the building
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot; was unaware that ! was supposed to quit.

~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: my faith in the TF700T is very thin
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: i&amp;#39;ve actually had a much better time with the tf100
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: i don&amp;#39;t know what happens to these two extra cores
                or that extra ram
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: but the tf100 performs much better with 2.6
                kernel/katkiss than this faster machine with 3.1 and 
                cyanogenmod
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: vere is basically unusable for divsem-misdef, too
                bad

~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: anyone out there?
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Present.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Though not for the auction.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: That was supposed to be today, wasn&amp;#39;t it?
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: It is today, it is happening now.
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I just heard it reported that the bid is at 7.1BTC
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: which is~0.1BTC more than I have
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I don&amp;#39;t know if just anyone can bid, or only those
                on the list
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: hackernews is back up, that&amp;#39;s good news
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: fantyv-ralpen: there&amp;#39;s also
                :~novrud-hanweb/try=/bin/chat now!
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Testing immediately.
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: if you&amp;#39;re in both rooms, you get all messages twice
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot; has left the building

~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: fantyv
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: maybe :room changes too
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: How did you alter line 97?
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: changed all yo to oy, zo to oz
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: err...
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: you know
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: then I did the same in room, and it seems to have
                fixed everything without a reload
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Copy.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Test
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Should I make similar modifications?
~hatteb-mitlyd &amp;quot;atax1a&amp;quot;: i found this internet numbers station reading a
                totally random file: http://unified.cf.gs:8000/listen.pls
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: you aren&amp;#39;t reading any of that are you
                fantyv-ralpen
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Nothing, sorry.
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: you need to ^D my chat and start it again from
                :~novrud-hanweb/try=/bin/chat
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: you&amp;#39;ll get try/3
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Yes, expected as much. Doing so now.
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: i&amp;#39;m running a main/2/bin/room/hoon now, that fixed
                everything
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: but you need a client that listens on the right
                ports
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Just sent a test string. What port needs changing?
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: if you run~novrud-hanweb/try=/bin/chat you get the
                new version
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Just did.
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: i changed %yo to %zo and %oy to %oz
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: still nothing huh
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: maybe your old client needs to timeout first
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: you know, i&amp;#39;m not sure it worked
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Second test sent.
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: it&amp;#39;s harder because I don&amp;#39;t know what channel I
                received that message on
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Second test sent.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: That was in~doznec chat.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Just tried another yebyen-chat message.
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: yeah so it must not have worked
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: my = still doesn&amp;#39;t work
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Trying to connect to yy-chat with a second destroyer.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: [waiting...]
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I guess it did not work.
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: something must still look for %yo or %oy
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: but nothing in either of these files, room.hoon or
                chat.hoon
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: hello there ikari
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Sending messages to yy-chat from alternate destroyer.
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: i see sarlug-picwep is my neighbor, but that&amp;#39;s it
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: no messages
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: My ships can&amp;#39;t see each other inside yy-chat either.
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Messages are only visible to the ship that transmits.
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: I changed yo in room.hoon
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: line 163, [/zo [%lq %zo]]
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: and 187, and 153 had %oy, turned into %oz
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: don&amp;#39;t know why it didn&amp;#39;t work
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: but it&amp;#39;s late here on the east coast!
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: gotta work tomorrow, unless cold snap
~novrud-hanweb &amp;quot;yebyen&amp;quot;: peace ^_^
~fantyv-ralpen &amp;quot;jpt4&amp;quot;: Auf wiedersehen.

   <title>Urbit Is &#58; Chapter 0</title>
   <link href="http://urbit.org/2013/12/13/urbit-ch0.html"/>
   <updated>2013-12-13T17:23:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://urbit.org/2013/12/13/urbit-ch0</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greetings from the off-world colonies! I’m your guide and scribe, &lt;code&gt;atax1a&lt;/code&gt;, a character from a book that hasn’t been written yet. Every great book has a Chapter 0, though, and you are reading mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am often asked&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what_is_urbit&quot;&gt;What Is Urbit?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urbit could be a way of sharing your data in a way that makes it live forever. Maybe it’s a Facebook of memories, 140 Twitters of words, or an Instagram for when you’re a grandpa. Maybe you send Urbit an email. You can hit it with your web browser right now, but that’s a bit rough around the edges. (Given time, it could even be that BBS or MUD that you wanted, but could never have…) It could be anything — right now, we use it as a glorified chat program, but one that never loses messages. Well, almost never. Sometimes we have to reboot the Universe, and everything we haven’t backed up is lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may be getting the idea that Urbit is hard to define precisely. It is, because it isn’t finished yet. In reality, Urbit is just a labyrinth of code, written as a book, running on a virtual machine (possibly running on another virtual machine, and so on), built out of physical parts, and it’s read and written )and edited( by human mammals on a planet called Earth. (The Urbit computer follows a “Hears, knows, does” model, which I can explain later.) A lot of Earthlings call it an art project, which isn’t far off. Sometime it’s Dada, other times it’s baroque, but it always has a precise scientific backing in the form of &lt;em&gt;Nock&lt;/em&gt;, which are the fundamental axioms (rules) of the Urbiverse. Nock is all numbers, tho, and it’s tiring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urbit is also a programming language. We call that &lt;em&gt;Hoon&lt;/em&gt;, for reasons I’m still not quite clear on. It takes Nock’s numbers and puts symbols on them. They’re kinda weird symbols, and most “real” programmers I know (and work with) take one look at something like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;|=(x=@ ?:((lth x 2) 1 (add $(x (dec x)) $(x (sub x 2)))))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and go pale around the gills. Myself, I grew up speaking a language called &lt;code&gt;perl&lt;/code&gt;, which has an even bigger love-affair with special characters, so reading this doesn’t faze me (Hoon uses its special characters judiciously, so please don’t think of &lt;code&gt;perl&lt;/code&gt; unless you like that sort of thing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An earlier version of Urbit (when Hoon was still called Watt) was rejected from a real scientific conference because the judges felt vaguely insulted by the nonstandard language. The Urbit you’re looking at now has had a few years to cool down and mature, and right now it’s so cool at the core that it’s well below -400 Fahrenheit. Thankfully, there is an entire planet built up around its icy core, and on the surface of that planet, it’s a balmy 25 degrees Celsius, and the water is like glass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urbit is currently only usable by a hyperliterate set of people — it’s immersed in the culture of the word, and it’s struggling for a glimpse of air, the sound of music, and a taste of freedom. Really, though, it’s easy to teach yourself, if you work through it with a dedicated mind. Having a friend along for the ride is definitely recommended. People with prior programming experience are welcome, but be warned: your existing biases and expectations are wrong. We’ll try and be gentle about breaking them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why_should_i_care_the_buried_lede&quot;&gt;Why should I care? (the buried lede)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, Urbit is a single global computer. Think “Cyberspace” from &lt;em&gt;Neuromancer&lt;/em&gt;, or “The Metaverse” from &lt;em&gt;Snow Crash&lt;/em&gt;. If you’re really early, think of Haflinger’s worm from &lt;em&gt;The Shockwave Rider&lt;/em&gt;. But don’t think of it as the Internet — the internet is a single global &lt;em&gt;network&lt;/em&gt;, and it only follows two rules: you can act like a UNIX machine when prompted, and you speak TCP/IP. Anyone can see what you’re saying, and most people can understand it. There are gaps in the network, too: &lt;em&gt;The Great Firewall Of China&lt;/em&gt;, anyone? “Encryption”, or as I might call it, &lt;em&gt;privacy&lt;/em&gt;, is an afterthought, and people who Never Say Anything can read a lot of supposedly “private” things, just by doing the right math. &lt;em&gt;Urbit isn’t like that&lt;/em&gt;. It enables secure, private, computing, in a way that nobody else can, because it is “semantically isolated” — the meaning of the Urbit program is independent of the outside world (in this case, the Internet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urbit works like an Internet should. If you know someone’s address, you can send them a message. It will either reliably be delivered, or get rejected. Likewise with requesting something: if you ask for tomorrow’s newspaper headline &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;, Urbit will gladly give it to you… tomorrow. Your ship just waits for it to come in, and when it does, everything proceeds like normal. “HTTP 404 Not Found”? What the &lt;code&gt;!^&amp;amp;#&lt;/code&gt; does THAT mean?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;who_are_you_people&quot;&gt;Who ARE you people?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re dreamers, but the dream escaped and is slowly consuming the real world. We’re programmers with a sense of humor and an overload of whimsy. At the end of the day, though, we’re just people just like you. People who want to change the world. Everyone wants to change the world, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;and_what_is_with_all_of_the_weird_words&quot;&gt;And what is with all of the weird words?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urbit is a piece of technology. Unfortunately, technology is hard to explain, and it gets harder when the words we use to explain it are misunderstood. If you’re used to speaking about your computers in terms of a Unix (or Windows) workstation, it’s a bit of a leap to think in terms of Urbit ships in a pier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, we use weird words to force a change in how our technology is perceived. Without that, readers are likely to gloss over important details, thinking that they understand more than they really do. It’s why we redefine everything, change the pronunciation of the symbols you’re used to, and even have our own number system. Count with me, and feel free to scribble in the margins:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~zod 0   (also &amp;#39;yes&amp;#39;)                 if i were rewriting this
~nec 1   (no)                            i would put &amp;#39;can&amp;#39; b4
~bud 2   [the rest of the numberz        &amp;#39;change meaning…&amp;#39;
~wes 3        change meaning
~sev 4    according to context]
~per 5   ---
~sut 6   &amp;lt;but that&amp;#39;s 0kay&amp;gt;
~let 7   
~ful 8   
~pen 9   ¡you can figure it out!&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saying them out loud helps. You and your friend can agree on the pronunciation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;introductions&quot;&gt;Introductions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get in touch with me on Urbit, of course. Join up to &lt;code&gt;:chat&lt;/code&gt; and use &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; to see who’s in the room. On the old internet, I go by many names, but on this one I try to stick with &lt;code&gt;~hatteb-mitlyd&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ever, as before, does Madness remain a mysterious-terrific, altogether infernal boiling-up of the Nether Chaotic Deep, through this fair-painted Vision of Creation, which swims thereon, which we name the Real.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Carlyle)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;urbit-is-easy-ch9.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prev&lt;/strong&gt;: Tiles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;on_type_inference_algorithms&quot;&gt;On type inference algorithms&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoon is a higher-order typed functional language. Most languages in this class, Haskell and ML being prominent examples, use something called the Hindley-Milner unification algorithm. Hoon uses its own special sauce instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? There are two obvious problems with H-M as a functional type system, the main one being the wall of heavy-ass mathematics that greets you instantly when you google it. We have heard some claims that H-M is actually quite simple. We urge all such claimants to hie themselves to its Wikipedia page, which they’ll surely be able to relieve of its present alarming resemblance to some string-theory paper in Physics Review D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Nor is this in any way an an anti-academic stance. Quite the contrary. Frankly, OS guys really quite seldom find themselves in the math-department lounge, cadging stray grants by shamelessly misrepresenting the CAP theorem as a result in mathematics. It doesn’t seem too much to expect the mathematicians to reciprocate this basic academic courtesy - how about it, old chaps?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, besides the drawback that it reeks of math and programmers who love math are about as common as cats who love a bath - a problem, but really only a marketing problem - H-M has a genuine product problem as well. It’s too powerful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, H-M reasons both forward with evaluation, and backward from constraints. Pretty unavoidable in any sort of unification algorithm, obviously. But since the compiler has to think both forward and backward, and the programmer has to predict what the compiler will do, the programmer has to think backward as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoon’s philosophy is that a language is a UI for programmers, and the basic test of a UI is to be, ya know, easy. It is impossible (for most programmers) to learn a language properly unless they know what the compiler is doing, which in practice means mentally stepping through the algorithms it uses (with the exception of semantically neutral optimizations). Haskell is a hard language to learn (for most programmers) because it’s hard (for most programmers) to follow what the Haskell compiler is thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s true that some programmers have an effective mathematical intuition that let them “see” algorithms without working through them step by step. But this is a rare talent, we feel. And even those who have a talent don’t always enjoy exercising it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a thorough understanding of any language demands high-grade mathematical intuition in its programmers, the language as a UI is like a doorway that makes you duck if you’re over 6 feet tall. The only reason to build such a doorway in your castle is if you and all your friends are short, and only your enemies are tall. Is this really the case here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although an inference algorithm that reasons only forward must and does require a few more annotations from the programmer, the small extra burden on her fingers is more than offset by the lighter load on her hippocampus. Furthermore, programs also exist to be read. The modern code monkey is above all things a replaceable part, and some of these annotations (which a smarter algorithm might infer by steam) may annoy the actual author of the code but be a lifesaver for her replacement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lowpowered_type_inference&quot;&gt;Low-powered type inference&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadly speaking, type inference in Hoon has three general limitations as compared to H-M inference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One&lt;/em&gt;, Hoon really does not think backwards. For instance, it cannot infer a function’s argument type (or to use Hoonese, a gate’s sample type) from its body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two&lt;/em&gt;, Hoon can infer through tail recursion, but not head recursion. It can &lt;em&gt;check&lt;/em&gt; head recursion, however, given an annotation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Three&lt;/em&gt;, the compiler catches most but not all divergent inference problems - ie, if you really screw up, you can put the compiler into an infinite loop or exponential equivalent. That’s ok, because an interrupt will still show you your error location. Also, this never happens once you know what you’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our experience is that these limitations are minor annoyances at worst and prudent restrictions at best. Your mileage may vary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good basic test for the power of a type inference algorithm is whether, given a grammar for a complex AST, it can verify statically that the noun produced by an LL combinator parser for the grammar actually fits in the AST type. (It would be quite surprising to see any language solve this for an LR parser.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoon indeed checks its own LL parser. Moreover, the core of the Hoon compiler - &lt;code&gt;++ut&lt;/code&gt;, which handles both type inference and Nock generation, is less than 2000 lines (and feels a bit bloated at that, since for obvious reasons it is relatively old code). Hoon is pretty expressive, but not &lt;code&gt;that&lt;/code&gt; expressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we feel Hoon’s approach to type inference offers, beneath its rich Corinthian leather, an unrivalled balance of simplicity and power. Still, don’t take it out on the freeway till you’re pretty sure you know how to drive it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;facts_to_keep_in_mind&quot;&gt;Facts to keep in mind&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Type inference is a frightening problem, especially if you’ve been exposed to the wall of math. Your only real problem in learning Hoon is to learn not to fear it. Once you work past this reasonable but entirely unfounded fear of inference, your Hoon experience will be simple, refreshing and delightful. So first, let’s talk through a few reassuring facts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One&lt;/em&gt;, it’s important to remember - having just read about tiles - that type inference in Hoon &lt;em&gt;never sees a tile&lt;/em&gt;. It operates exclusively on twigs. All tiles and synthetic twigs are reduced to natural twigs for the inference engine’s benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two&lt;/em&gt;, the semantics of Hoon are in &lt;code&gt;++ut&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;hoon.hoon&lt;/code&gt;, and nowhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Three&lt;/em&gt;, within &lt;code&gt;++ut&lt;/code&gt;, all the semantics of Hoon are in the call graph of one arm - &lt;code&gt;++mint&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;++mint&lt;/code&gt; has a case for every natural hoon. So do &lt;code&gt;++play&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;++mull&lt;/code&gt;, but their semantics are redundant with &lt;code&gt;++mint&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Four&lt;/em&gt;, one leg in the sample of &lt;code&gt;++mint&lt;/code&gt; - &lt;code&gt;gol&lt;/code&gt; - which looks for all the world like a mechanism for backward inference, is not. It is semantically irrelevant and only exists to get better localization on error reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Five&lt;/em&gt;, we’ve already explained what &lt;code&gt;++mint&lt;/code&gt; does, but let’s repeat it one more time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we have a type that describes the subject for the formula we’re trying to generate, as we generate that formula we want to also generate a type for the product of that formula on that subject. So our compiler computes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[subject-type twig] =&amp;gt; [product-type formula]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as &lt;code&gt;subject-type&lt;/code&gt; is a correct description of some subject, you can take any twig and compile it against &lt;code&gt;subject-type&lt;/code&gt;, producing a &lt;code&gt;formula&lt;/code&gt; such that &lt;code&gt;*(subject
formula)&lt;/code&gt; is a product correctly described by &lt;code&gt;product-type&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;++mint&lt;/code&gt; is the gate that maps &lt;code&gt;[type twig]&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;[type nock]&lt;/code&gt;. So, if you know &lt;code&gt;++mint&lt;/code&gt;, you know Hoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Six&lt;/em&gt;, most of the things &lt;code&gt;++mint&lt;/code&gt; does are obvious. For instance, let’s quickly run through how &lt;code&gt;++mint&lt;/code&gt; handles a &lt;code&gt;=+&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;tislus&lt;/code&gt;) twig, &lt;code&gt;[%tsls p=twig q=twig]&lt;/code&gt;. This is a synthetic twig:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;++  open
  ^-  twig
  ?-  gen
    [%tsls *]  [%tsgr [p.gen [~ 1]] q.gen]
  ==&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ie, &lt;code&gt;=+(a b)&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt;([a .] b)&lt;/code&gt;. We thus turn to the &lt;code&gt;%tsgr&lt;/code&gt; twig in &lt;code&gt;++mint&lt;/code&gt;. Simplifying broadly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;++  mint
  |=  [sut=type gen=twig]
  ^-  [p=type q=nock]
  ?-    gen
      [%tsgr *]
    =+  fid=$(gen p.gen)
    =+  dov=$(sut p.fid, gen q.gen)
    [p.dov (comb q.fid q.dov)]
  ==
++  comb
  |=  [mal=nock buz=nock]
  ^-  nock
  ?:  &amp;amp;(?=([0 *] mal) !=(0 p.mal))
    ?:  &amp;amp;(?=([0 *] buz) !=(0 p.buz))
      [%0 (peg p.mal p.buz)]
    ?:  ?=([2 [0 *] [0 *]] buz)
      [%2 [%0 (peg p.mal p.p.buz)] [%0 (peg p.mal p.q.buz)]]
    [%7 mal buz]
  ?:  ?=([^ [0 1]] mal)
    [%8 p.mal buz]
  ?:  =([0 1] buz)
    mal
  [%7 mal buz]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may not be obvious what &lt;code&gt;++comb&lt;/code&gt; is doing, but we can guess that it’s composing two Nock formulas, and in particular doing its best to get back the &lt;code&gt;%8&lt;/code&gt; shorthand that we might have otherwise thrown away by making &lt;code&gt;=+&lt;/code&gt; a synthetic hoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you understand this, you understand the general problem that &lt;code&gt;++mint&lt;/code&gt; is solving. Now, let’s dive into the details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pseudolazy_evaluation_hold&quot;&gt;Pseudolazy evaluation: %hold&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll start by introducing a new type stem, &lt;code&gt;%hold&lt;/code&gt; (yes, we are bringing them in one by one like Gandalf’s dwarves):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;++  type  $|  ?(%noun %void)
          $%  [%atom p=term]
              [%cell p=type q=type]
              [%core p=type q=coil]
              [%cube p=* q=type]
              [%face p=term q=type]
              [%fork p=type q=type]
              [%hold p=(list ,[p=type q=twig])]
          ==&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(There is now only one type stem that’s missing - and a relatively frivolous and unimportant stem at that.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;%hold&lt;/code&gt; looks a little bit funky there. Let’s indulge in a little more unlicensed simplifying, and pretend it was instead&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[%hold p=type q=twig]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The actual &lt;code&gt;%hold&lt;/code&gt;, with its list, is just a big &lt;code&gt;%fork&lt;/code&gt;; and can be adequately represented, at least semantically, by a nested &lt;code&gt;%fork&lt;/code&gt; of simple holds like this one. The reasons it doesn’t work this way are unimportant and we can forget them for now.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the semantics of a &lt;code&gt;%hold&lt;/code&gt;? Simple - this type delegates to the value, also of course a type, &lt;code&gt;p:(mint p q)&lt;/code&gt;. (Once again, in the real &lt;code&gt;hoon.hoon&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;++mint&lt;/code&gt; interface is also slightly different from our caricature here.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we see how infinite types, such as a linked list, can be constructed. Hoon, of course, is a strict language (ie, one without lazy evaluation, like Haskell) and cannot construct an infinitely long linked list. We certainly can describe, as a &lt;code&gt;++type&lt;/code&gt;, the infinite set which contains all linked lists - or all lists of a given item type, eg, &lt;code&gt;[p=type q=twig]&lt;/code&gt;. But this infinite set must be defined in a very finite noun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we traverse this finite noun by expanding &lt;code&gt;%hold&lt;/code&gt; stems, we implicitly produce the illusion of an infinite type - for instance, one that in the case of a linked list of @tas, was&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ %fork
  [%cube 0 %atom %n]
  [ %cell
    [%atom %tas]
    [ %fork
      [%cube 0 %atom %n]
      [ %cell
        [%atom %tas]
        [ %fork
          [%cube 0 %atom %n]
          ... &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and it’s turtles all the way down. (&lt;code&gt;[%cube 0 %atom %n]&lt;/code&gt; is of course the null terminator, &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infinite state is not required to produce this sequence ad infinitum. In any language, this is essentially what an infinite list &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; - an indefinite pattern generated from finite state.. But in Hoon, the illusion is produced at the user level, not hidden in the language semantics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it’s not clear why this is superior&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, you want to define an infinite list. But your physical computer is finite. So, your infinite list must consist of some kind of generated pattern. Lots of ways to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the right way to manage this finite state? State of this kind can be expressed in three forms: (a) the actual data structure that the pattern contains; (b) a core, which takes this payload and wraps a pattern generator around it; (c) an abstraction, which makes the generator indistinguishable from simple list data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems clear that since (a) can be converted into (b), and (b) into (c), the best representation is (a). For instance, (a) is easy to send over a network, (b) is clunky at best (we really try to never send nock over the network), (c) is a research project. In short, lazy evaluation is inherently a leaky abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how_we_use_hold&quot;&gt;How we use %hold&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one advantage of explicit over implicit laziness which would leave us no choice but to use explicit laziness in &lt;code&gt;++ut&lt;/code&gt;, even if we expressed the same semantics in a language with built-in implicit laziness (like Haskell).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advantage is that the explicit pattern state makes a good search key for an associative array, ie, &lt;code&gt;++map&lt;/code&gt; in Hoon. The problem of using an infinite expansion as a search key in a lazy language is one I’d be surprised to see solved, and even more surprised to see solved well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the function computed by &lt;code&gt;++nest&lt;/code&gt;. Again simplifying the interesting core structure of &lt;code&gt;++ut&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;(nest sut ref)&lt;/code&gt; is yes if &lt;em&gt;it can verify that&lt;/em&gt; every noun which is a member of type &lt;code&gt;ref&lt;/code&gt; is also a member of type &lt;code&gt;sut&lt;/code&gt;. In other words, &lt;code&gt;++nest&lt;/code&gt; is a conservative algorithm - it sometimes busts the innocent, it always nails the guilty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;code&gt;++nest&lt;/code&gt; and everything else in the Hoon type system practice a policy of pure “structural equivalence.” Even %face is ignored for compatibility purposes; only noun geometry is considered. If it walks like a duck, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(You can look at &lt;code&gt;++nest&lt;/code&gt; yourself. It is a big function for Hoon: 150 lines, though arranged quite loosely (it should be more like 120) with a complex internal core.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look again at &lt;code&gt;++type&lt;/code&gt; above and forget about &lt;code&gt;%hold&lt;/code&gt;, it is probably not hard to imagine building a &lt;code&gt;++nest&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;em&gt;finite&lt;/em&gt; type nouns. (The problem is not even equivalent to SAT, because there is a unification stem but no intersection stem.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for (logically) infinite types? Yes - actually, the problem is straightforward. But the solution requires us to use &lt;code&gt;%hold&lt;/code&gt; types as search keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially, &lt;code&gt;++nest&lt;/code&gt; can begin by assuming that every &lt;code&gt;ref&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;code&gt;sut&lt;/code&gt;, then traverse the parallel trees searching for any case of a &lt;code&gt;ref&lt;/code&gt; that might conceal a non-&lt;code&gt;sut&lt;/code&gt;. In this traverse, we can simply keep a set of the &lt;code&gt;[sut ref]&lt;/code&gt; problems we are solving:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;=+  gil=*(set ,[p=type q=type])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, &lt;code&gt;gil&lt;/code&gt; is just the &lt;code&gt;++nest&lt;/code&gt; stack as a live problem set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we descend into another instance of the search tree we’re actually in, ie, currently searching for exceptions to the compatibility assumption, there is no reason to restart our search. So, we can prune and ignore these recurrences. And so, we can write a decent &lt;code&gt;++nest&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every nontrivial algorithm that traverses types keeps one of these recurrence sets to detect repeating patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leaves the onus on the programmer to design types that recur regularly. An infinite type &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; be traversed if the actual &lt;code&gt;[%hold p=type q=twig]&lt;/code&gt; in it does not recur, &lt;em&gt;with the exact same type and twig nouns&lt;/em&gt;. Indeed, doing anything significant with this type will cause the compiler to hang (requiring an interrupt, which will tell you where you made this mistake).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, doing the right thing here is much easier than doing the wrong thing. Why would you roll your own &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt;, anyway? Use the standard tools and everything will work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;where_we_use_hold&quot;&gt;Where we use %hold&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everywhere. But more specifically, every time a wing resolves to an arm, we don’t trace into the callee; we make a &lt;code&gt;%hold&lt;/code&gt;. Hence, in practice the type in a &lt;code&gt;%hold&lt;/code&gt; is always a &lt;code&gt;%core&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When other typed functional languages construct or define a gate, lambda, closure, function, etc, they generally compute a “type signature” for the function. Ie, it accepts &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; and produces &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;. You will see things in Hoon gates that look to all the world like type signatures. They aren’t type signatures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Hoon, if the compiler wants to traverse the type a gate produces, it simply iterates a subject through the AST - the twig. In doing so, we start with the subject&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[%hold gate-type gate-twig]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and iterate into it, reducing as needed, and checking wherever possible for logic loops, until we find what we want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logically this iteration is always the same as &lt;code&gt;q:(mint p q)&lt;/code&gt;, but in actual practice &lt;code&gt;++mint&lt;/code&gt; is making a formula we don’t need. Also, we only need to actually verify correctness when we generate a formula - not when we traverse pseudolazy types. Hence, we have the lighter &lt;code&gt;++play&lt;/code&gt; gate for traversal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;head_and_tail_recursion&quot;&gt;Head and tail recursion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;^-&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;kethep&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%kthp&lt;/code&gt;) twig,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[%kthp p=tile q=twig]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;produces the type &lt;code&gt;p:(mint sub ~(bunt al p.gen))&lt;/code&gt; and the formula &lt;code&gt;q:(mint sub q.gen)&lt;/code&gt;, checking that &lt;code&gt;p:(mint sub q.gen)&lt;/code&gt; nests in &lt;code&gt;p:(mint sub ~(bunt al p.gen))&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to avoid the word “cast” when talking about &lt;code&gt;%kthp&lt;/code&gt;, so we relent and use it. Essentially we are casting the product of twig &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; to the icon of tile &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Casting should not be confused with fishing. &lt;code&gt;%kthp&lt;/code&gt; is a purely static operation with no runtime effect whatsoever.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a good general principle to cast the product of every arm. First, because &lt;code&gt;%face&lt;/code&gt; is ignored by &lt;code&gt;++nest&lt;/code&gt;, the cast is an opportunity to get the names right - for example, your arm can produce &lt;code&gt;[foo bar]&lt;/code&gt; and cast it at the end to &lt;code&gt;[p=foo q=bar]&lt;/code&gt;. The type produced by mere inference on practical code may be funky, duplicative, poorly named, etc, etc. Even if it’s not, it’s often good to remind the reader what just got made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, when an arm is used in head recursion, casting its product becomes essential. Our simplistic inference algorithm cannot follow head recursion; but it can check that every step in head recursion is correct, leaving no loophole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key point is that since &lt;code&gt;++play&lt;/code&gt; does not verify, it does not need to descend into twig &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; at all. Thus when we type-check head recursion, we check that any step is correct, assuming any further steps are correct - a positive answer is dispositive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t completely understand (or believe) this, or if you are not quite sure on the difference between head and tail recursion, just cast the product of every arm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;%kthp&lt;/code&gt; also has an irregular wide form. &lt;code&gt;^-(@tas foo)&lt;/code&gt; can also be written&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;`@tas`foo&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, although Hoon is perfectly capable of inferring that decrement produces an atom, the decrement in &lt;code&gt;hoon.hoon&lt;/code&gt; casts the product of the loop step anyway:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;=+  b=0
|-  ^-  @
?:  =(a +(b))
  b
$(b +(b))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that this is just a fancy modern arrangement of the classic Hoon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;=+  b=0
|-  
^-  @
?:  =(a +(b))
  b
$(b +(b))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ie, it is only by casting &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; the arm that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idiom of “barhep kethep tile” is common enough that you should rarely see a &lt;code&gt;|-&lt;/code&gt; without a &lt;code&gt;^-&lt;/code&gt;. Especially while still a beginning Hoon programmer - when in doubt, cast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;branch_analysis&quot;&gt;Branch analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Type inference wouldn’t be very useful or interesting if we couldn’t learn things about our nouns at runtime. Actually, we can’t even really &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; most nouns without type inference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, let’s make a list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; =foo `(list ,@)`[1 2 3 4 ~]
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; foo
~[1 2 3 4]
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; foo
~[1 2 3 4]
it(@)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks good. (Our prettyprinter has traversed the &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; type and matched it to its own list detection heuristic - which is the only way we can print a list as such, since &lt;code&gt;++list&lt;/code&gt; is just a gate and no trace of the word &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; remains in the type.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s try to use it. What’s the first item?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; i.foo
! -type.it(@)
! -find-limb.i
! find-fork
! exit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doh! We got a &lt;code&gt;find-fork&lt;/code&gt; because, with the cast, we threw away our knowledge that we had &lt;code&gt;[1 2 3 4 ~]&lt;/code&gt; and replaced it with a repeating structure that is either &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;[i=@ t=(list ,@)]&lt;/code&gt;. We cannot pull &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt;, because we don’t know that &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; is not &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we’ve lost that information, we need a way to test for it dynamically, and change the type of &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; on either side of the branch. To wit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; ?~(foo 42 i.foo)
1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is &lt;code&gt;?~&lt;/code&gt; - &lt;code&gt;wutsig&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%wtsg&lt;/code&gt;? A simple synthetic that use our fishing hoon, &lt;code&gt;?=&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;wuttis&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; ?:(?=(~ foo) 42 i.foo)
1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt; side of the &lt;code&gt;?:&lt;/code&gt;, we know that &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; is not &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; - and because it’s not &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;, it has to be a cell. We can see the type system learning this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; ?~(foo !! foo)
[i=1 t=~[2 3 4]]
[i=@ t=it(@)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice also the use of &lt;code&gt;!!&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;!!&lt;/code&gt; always crashes - so it produces the type &lt;code&gt;%void&lt;/code&gt;. We’re essentially asserting that &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; is a non-empty list. A branch that produces &lt;code&gt;%void&lt;/code&gt; will never return a value (if taken, it will always crash), so its product can be ignored. If we changed that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; ?~(foo %foobar foo)
[i=1 t=~[2 3 4]]
{ %foobar [i=@ t=it(@)] }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; hoons recognized in branch analysis are &lt;code&gt;?=&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;wuttis&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%wtts&lt;/code&gt;, fish), &lt;code&gt;?&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;wutpam&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%wtts&lt;/code&gt;, logical and), and &lt;code&gt;?|&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;wutbar&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%wtbr&lt;/code&gt;, logical or). (Boolean logic is fully understood within the test itself, so the second twig in a &lt;code&gt;?&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; can depend on the result of the first.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, synthetic hoons that reduce to these work as well. However, we don’t learn from any other test, even if we could:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; ?:(?=(~ foo) 42 i.foo)
1
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; ?:(=(~ foo) 42 i.foo)
! -type.it(@)
! -find-limb.i
! find-fork
! exit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Type inference in Hoon is anything but magic. It’s a relatively simple algorithm, which you nonetheless need to understand if you’re going to make it as a Hoon programmer. “It just works” and “do what I mean” are not in the building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All branches (such as &lt;code&gt;?~&lt;/code&gt;) reduce to &lt;code&gt;?:&lt;/code&gt;. It would appear, for instance, that Hoon has (like many other functional languages) pattern-matching primitives, &lt;code&gt;?-&lt;/code&gt; (and &lt;code&gt;?+&lt;/code&gt;, which takes a default). Au contraire - these are just synthesized from &lt;code&gt;?:&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;?=&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, another thing that branch analysis can do is statically detect that branches aren’t taken. For instance, with our little &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; list, we cannot know &lt;em&gt;statically&lt;/em&gt; whether or not it’s null, but we can test it &lt;em&gt;dynamically&lt;/em&gt;. Statically, however, we know one thing - &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; cannot have the value &lt;code&gt;%foobar&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what happens if we fish for it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~zod/try=&amp;gt; ?:(?=(%foobar foo) 42 i.foo)
! mint-vain
! exit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For lo, we fish in vain. We get this error whenever a branch is not taken. This is tremendously useful when, for example, &lt;code&gt;?-&lt;/code&gt; switches on a kelp - if we write a case for a stem that doesn’t exist, or miss a stem that must be handled, the compiler knows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;geometric_and_generic_polymorphism&quot;&gt;Geometric and generic polymorphism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One interesting question in any language is what happens when you pass a function an argument more specialized than its declaration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider a function that takes a pair &lt;code&gt;[a b]&lt;/code&gt; and produces [b a]. Any noun will obviously do for &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;. So the sample tile is &lt;code&gt;[a=\* b=\*]&lt;/code&gt;. But suppose the caller knows something more about &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;. What happens? Let’s give it a try:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~zod/try=&amp;gt; :type; (|=([a=* b=*] [b a]) %foo %bar)
[7.496.034 7.303.014]
[* *]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With &lt;code&gt;|=&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;bartis&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%brts&lt;/code&gt;), the normal way of building a gate, we lost all our type information. Sometimes this is fine. Sometimes it’s exactly what we want. But sometimes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s something else we can do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~zod/try=&amp;gt; :type; (|*([a=* b=*] [b a]) %foo %bar)
[%bar %foo]
[%bar %foo]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using &lt;code&gt;|\*&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;bartar&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%brtr&lt;/code&gt;), we seem to have produced the same noun, but not lost any type information. Interesting&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference is that while both &lt;code&gt;|=&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;|\*&lt;/code&gt; are polymorphic, &lt;code&gt;|=&lt;/code&gt; uses &lt;em&gt;geometric&lt;/em&gt; polymorphism and &lt;code&gt;|\*&lt;/code&gt; uses &lt;em&gt;generic&lt;/em&gt;. Which should you choose?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a simple rule for this, which is that unless you are a wizard doing wizardly things, you should use &lt;code&gt;|=&lt;/code&gt;. Generic polymorphism is a way to build and use tools like containers (lists, etc), which in other, inferior languages might simply be built in to the language semantics. Especially as a new Hoon programmer, you are probably not building heavy machinery of this kind, and should probably make do with the standard components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you will be &lt;em&gt;using&lt;/em&gt; containers, etc. So there’s no shortcut for understanding both systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;geometric_polymorphism&quot;&gt;Geometric polymorphism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve already met the fundamental function of geometric polymorphism, &lt;code&gt;++nest&lt;/code&gt;. The question &lt;code&gt;(nest sut ref)&lt;/code&gt; asks is: can I take any noun in type &lt;code&gt;ref&lt;/code&gt;, and use it as if it was within &lt;code&gt;sut&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the trivial example above - the question is, can we use our noun [%foo %bar] as if it was a &lt;code&gt;[a=\* b=\*]&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we use &lt;code&gt;%=&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;centis&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%cnts&lt;/code&gt;) to modify the sample in a core, we actually change the type of the core. (Of course we are not &lt;em&gt;modifying&lt;/em&gt; the core per se, but creating a new one with the given changes.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ %core
  [ %cell 
    [%cell [%face %a %noun] [%face %b %noun]]
    context
  ]
  (map term twig)
]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ %core
  [ %cell 
    [%cell [%cube %foo [%atom %tas]] [%cube %bar [%atom %tas]]]
    context
  ]
  (map term twig)
]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This poses a couple of problems. First, remember, when we infer into a gate call or any other use of a core arm, we infer lazily by creating a &lt;code&gt;[%hold type twig]&lt;/code&gt; with the subject core and the arm body. When we want to find out what type the arm produces, we simply step through it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But among other possible problems here, we’ve actually &lt;em&gt;destroyed our argument names&lt;/em&gt;. If we try to step through the body of the function with this modified core, we can’t possibly play &lt;code&gt;[b a]&lt;/code&gt;. The names &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; simply won’t resolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why a core is actually more complicated than our original explanation would suggest. The &lt;code&gt;%core&lt;/code&gt; frond is actually:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;++  type  $%  [%core p=type q=coil]
          ==
++  coil  $:  p=?(%gold %iron %lead %zinc)
              q=type
              r=[p=?(~ ^) q=(map term foot)]
          ==
++  foot  $%  [%ash p=twig]
              [%elm p=twig]
          ==&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Geeze, man, what is all this nonsense? Okay, fine. Let’s explain the real &lt;code&gt;%core&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;coil&lt;/code&gt; is the original payload type for use in a &lt;code&gt;%hold&lt;/code&gt;. Hence geometric polymorphism. The question we have to answer whenever we use an arm is: is this core corrupt? As in: is the payload that’s in it now geometrically compatible with the payload that its formulas were compiled with? Can we use the present payload as if it was the original, default payload?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is actually not a type error of any kind to produce a modified core with the payload set to any kind of garbage at all. It’s just a type error to &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; it - unless the payload is compatible. And when we use a geometric arm, we test this compatibility and then treat the present sample as if it was the original.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;q.r&lt;/code&gt; in the coil is the map of arms. The polymorphism model is not an attribute of the core, but of the arm - &lt;code&gt;%ash&lt;/code&gt; means geometric, &lt;code&gt;%elm&lt;/code&gt; means generic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;p.r&lt;/code&gt;, if not null, is the actual generated battery of Nock formulas. Why do we need this at compile time? Remember &lt;code&gt;%ktsg&lt;/code&gt;, which folds constants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;p.r&lt;/code&gt; is null while we are compiling the core’s own arms, for obvious reasons (though we could get a little smarter about circularities), but once we complete this task we can put the battery in the type. The result is that, if we are building a reef of cores, we can fold arms of this core in the next one down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, one of the main uses of &lt;code&gt;%ktsg&lt;/code&gt; is simply to make default samples constant, so that we don’t have to perform some simple but unnecessary computation every time we use a gate. Because we can only fold an arm in a completed core, a good general practice in building applications is to use a reef of at least two cores - inner for the tiles, outer for the functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that remains is this mysterious &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; field. If you are an OO geek of a certain flavor who was once busted with a Sharpie for writing “BERTRAND MEYER IS GOD” on a Muni bus, you may be familiar with the broad language concept of &lt;em&gt;variance&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polymorphism in Hoon supports four kinds of variance: &lt;code&gt;%gold&lt;/code&gt; (invariant), &lt;code&gt;%lead&lt;/code&gt; (bivariant), &lt;code&gt;%zinc&lt;/code&gt; (covariant), and &lt;code&gt;%iron&lt;/code&gt; (contravariant).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of variance arises when we want to test whether one core is compatible with another. Hoon is a functional language, for example, so it would be nice to pass functions around. Gosh, even C can pass functions around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For core A to nest within core B (any A can be used as a B), it seems clear that A should have the same set of arms as B (with formulas at exactly the same axes in the battery), and that any product of an A arm should nest within the product of the corresponding B arm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what about the payloads? Worse - what about the &lt;em&gt;contexts&lt;/em&gt;? A simple rule might be that the payload of A must also nest within the payload of B. Unfortunately, this doesn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose, for instance, that I write a sort gate, one of whose arguments is a comparison gate producing a loobean. (This is generally a problem calling for generic polymorphism, but let’s assume we’re sorting lists of a fixed type.) Okay, great. We know the &lt;em&gt;sample&lt;/em&gt; type of the comparator - but what about the &lt;em&gt;context&lt;/em&gt;? The sort library cannot possibly have the same context as the application which is using the sort library. So, the cores will be incompatible and the invocation will fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This rule, which doesn’t work in this case, is the rule for &lt;code&gt;%gold&lt;/code&gt; (invariant) cores. Every core is created &lt;code&gt;%gold&lt;/code&gt;, and remains &lt;code&gt;%gold&lt;/code&gt; from the perspective of its own arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the type of some arbitrary comparator, which is an argument to our sort function, cannot possibly be &lt;code&gt;%gold&lt;/code&gt;. Rather, we need an &lt;code&gt;%iron&lt;/code&gt; (contravariant) core. You can turn any &lt;code&gt;%gold&lt;/code&gt; core into an &lt;code&gt;%iron&lt;/code&gt; one with &lt;code&gt;^|&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;ketbar&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%ktbr&lt;/code&gt;), but the transformation is not reversible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rules for using an &lt;code&gt;%iron&lt;/code&gt; core are that (a) the context is opaque (can neither be read nor written), and (b) the sample is write-only. Why? Because it’s absolutely okay to use as your comparator a gate which accepts a more general sample than you’ll actually call it with. You can write a more specialized noun into this sample - but if you read the default value and treat it as more specialized, you have a type loophole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;%zinc&lt;/code&gt; (covariant) core is the opposite - the context remains opaque, the sample is read-only. We don’t use any &lt;code&gt;%zinc&lt;/code&gt; at present, but this is only because we haven’t yet gotten into inheritance and other fancy OO patterns. (Hoon 191 had inheritance, but it was removed as incompletely baked.) You make a &lt;code&gt;%gold&lt;/code&gt; core &lt;code&gt;%zinc&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;^&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;ketpam&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%ktpm&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the entire payload of a &lt;code&gt;%lead&lt;/code&gt; (invariant) core is immune to reading or writing. So all that matters is the product of the arms. You make a lead core with &lt;code&gt;^?&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;ketwut&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%ktwt&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;generic_polymorphism&quot;&gt;Generic polymorphism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the arm we’re executing is &lt;code&gt;%elm&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;%ash&lt;/code&gt;, there is actually &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; check that the payload in the actual core, type &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;, nests in the original payload &lt;code&gt;q.q&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, &lt;code&gt;%elm&lt;/code&gt; arms (defined not with &lt;code&gt;++&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;slus&lt;/code&gt;, which means &lt;code&gt;%ash&lt;/code&gt;, but &lt;code&gt;+-&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;shep&lt;/code&gt;) are actually &lt;em&gt;not even type-checked when compiled&lt;/em&gt;. They have to generate valid nock, but all verification is disabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? How? Because there’s another way of dealing with a core whose payload has been modified. In a sense, it’s incredibly crude and hacky. But it’s perfectly valid, and it lets Hoon provide the same basic feature set provided by generic features in other languages, such as Haskell’s typeclasses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logically, when we use an &lt;code&gt;%elm&lt;/code&gt;, generic or “wet” arm, we simply &lt;em&gt;recompile the entire twig&lt;/em&gt; with the changed payload. If this recompilation, which &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; typechecked, succeeds - and if it &lt;em&gt;produces exactly the same Nock formula&lt;/em&gt; - we know that we can use the modified core as if it was the original, without of course changing the static formula we generated once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does this work out to the same thing as a typeclass? Because with a wet core, we are essentially just using the source code of the core as a giant macro in a sense. Our only restriction is that because the Nock formula that actually executes the code must be the same formula we generated statically for the battery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a sense this defines an implicit typeclass: the class of types that can be passed through the arm, emerging intact and with an identical formula. But no declaration of any sort is required. You could call it “duck typeclassing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, a lot of caching is required to make this compile with reasonable efficiency. But computers these days are pretty fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This description of how wet arms work is not quite correct, though it’s the way ancient versions of Hoon worked. The problem is that there are some cases in which it’s okay if the modified core generates a different battery - for example, if the original battery takes branches that are not taken in this specific call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we have a function &lt;code&gt;++mull&lt;/code&gt; which tests whether a twig compiled with one subject will work with another. But still, thinking of the wet call check as a simple comparison of the compiled code is the best intuitive test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, your best bet as a novice Hoon programmer is to understand that this is how things like &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; work, that someone else who knows Hoon better than you wrote these tools, and that in general if you want to use generic polymorphism you’re probably making a mistake. But if you wonder how &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; works - this is how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;generic_polymorphism_action_sequences&quot;&gt;Generic polymorphism action sequences&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s deploy this boy! Here is &lt;code&gt;++list&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;++  list  |*(a=_,* $|(~ [i=a t=(list a)]))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t worry. This is just grievously badass hardcore Hoon - as irregular as Marseilles street slang. As a novice Hoon monkey, you won’t be writing &lt;code&gt;++list&lt;/code&gt; or anything like it, and you can stick to French as she is spoke in Paris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, at least this grizzled old baboon has no trouble parsing the apparent line noise above. Why so funky? Why, oh why, &lt;code&gt;\_,*&lt;/code&gt;? Because for various irrelevant reasons, the &lt;code&gt;++list&lt;/code&gt; here is trying as hard as possible to build itself out of tiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, in general in Hoon it is gauche for a gate to use its core’s namespace to recurse back into itself, but tiles do not expose their own internals to the twigs they contain (otherwise, obviously, they could not be hygienic).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;manipulate the subject such that it’s not possible to loop properly. So in fact there is no alternative but to use &lt;code&gt;(list
a)&lt;/code&gt; within &lt;code&gt;++list&lt;/code&gt; - a normal usage in complex tiles, but only in complex tiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a normal person wouldn’t use tiles to prove a point. They’d do it like this - let’s use the REPL to build a &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; replacement, without one single “obfuscated Hoon trick.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~zod/try=&amp;gt; =lust |*(a=$+(* *) |=(b=* ?@(b ~ [i=(a -.b) t=$(b +.b)])))
~zod/try=&amp;gt; ((lust ,@) 1 2 ~)
~[1 2]
~zod/try=&amp;gt; ((list ,@) 1 2 ~)
~[1 2]
~zod/try=&amp;gt; `(list ,@)``(lust ,@)`[1 2 ~]
~[1 2]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;lust&lt;/code&gt; do the same thing and are perfectly compatible. But sadly, &lt;code&gt;lust&lt;/code&gt; still looks like line noise. Let’s slip into something more comfortable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;|*  a=$+(* *)
|=  b=*
?@  b  ~
[i=(a -.b) t=$(b +.b)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We haven’t met &lt;code&gt;$+&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;buclus&lt;/code&gt;) yet. &lt;code&gt;$+(p q)&lt;/code&gt; is a tile for a gate which accepts &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; and produces &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt;. The spectre of function signatures once again rears its ugly head - but &lt;code&gt;$+(p q)&lt;/code&gt; is no different from &lt;code&gt;$\_(|+(p _q))&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, when we think of a wet gate (&lt;code&gt;|*&lt;/code&gt;) as a macro, we see (list ,@) producing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;|=  b=*
?@  b  ~
[i=(,@ -.b) t=$(b +.b)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This function is easily recognized as a gate accepting a noun and producing a list of atoms - in short, perfectly formed for an herbaceous tile. Pass it some random noun off the Internet, and it will give you a list of atoms. In fact, we could define it on its own as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;++  atls
  |=  b=*
  ?@  b  ~
  [i=(,@ -.b) t=$(b +.b)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and everywhere you write &lt;code&gt;(list ,@)&lt;/code&gt;, you could write &lt;code&gt;atls&lt;/code&gt;. Which would work perfectly despite its self-evident lameness. Note &lt;em&gt;in particular&lt;/em&gt; that the inner &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; gate is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; wet, but rather dry - once we have done our substitution, there is no need to get funky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s do some little fun thing with &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; - eg, gluing two lists together:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;++  weld
  ~/  %weld
  |*  [a=(list) b=(list)]
  =&amp;gt;  .(a ^.(homo a), b ^.(homo b))
  |-  ^+  b
  ?~  a  b
  [i.a $(a t.a)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is this &lt;code&gt;homo&lt;/code&gt; thing (meaning “homogenize”, of course)? Exactly that - it homogenizes the type of a list, producing its sample noun unchanged:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;++  homo
  |*  a=(list)
  ^+  =&amp;lt;  $
    |%  +-  $  ?:(_? ~ [i=(snag 0 a) t=$])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  a&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is more dark magic that should clearly be ignored. But essentially, to homogenize a list &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, we are casting &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; to a deranged pseudo-loop that produces an infinite stream of the first item in &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, selected via the &lt;code&gt;++snag&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;++  snag
  ~/  %snag
  |*  [a=@ b=(list)]
  |-
  ?~  b
    ~|(&amp;#39;snag-fail&amp;#39; !!)
  ?:  =(0 a)
    i.b
  $(b t.b, a (dec a))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;++snag&lt;/code&gt; of course selects any item in the list; but if &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; has a type more complex than a homogeneous list (eg, the type system might well know the number of items, etc, etc), Hoon is nowhere near enough to see that the counter is always 0. So the type produced by &lt;code&gt;++snag&lt;/code&gt; is the union of all list elements, which is precisely the type we want for our homogenized list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for &lt;code&gt;^.&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;ketdot&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%ktdt&lt;/code&gt;), we can see it in &lt;code&gt;++open&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  ++  open
    ^-  twig
    ?-  gen
      [%ktdt *]  [%ktls [%cnhp p.gen q.gen ~] q.gen]
    ==&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ie, &lt;code&gt;^.(a b)&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;^+((a b) b)&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;^-(_(a b) b)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;++weld&lt;/code&gt; prudently casts its product to the type of the base list &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;. In future this &lt;code&gt;^+&lt;/code&gt; will probably be removed, since we are perfectly capable of inferring that when you weld &lt;code&gt;(list a)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(list b)&lt;/code&gt;, you get a &lt;code&gt;(list ?(a b))&lt;/code&gt;. But there’s old code this change might confuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short: generic polymorphism is cool but wacky. Leave it to the experts, please!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Carlyle)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;urbit-is-easy-ch8.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prev&lt;/strong&gt;: Gates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tiles&quot;&gt;Tiles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We actually told a little white lie when we said that a Hoon file turns into a twig. Well, sort of. It does turn into a twig. But parts of it often start out as something else - a &lt;code&gt;tile&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is a tile? First, concretely, a tile is an AST subtree that’s reduced statically into a twig. It can be reduced in four ways - cryptically called &lt;code&gt;bunt&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;clam&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;fish&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;whip&lt;/code&gt;. A tile is always some leg of a twig, and that twig defines how the tile is reduced. (Don’t worry, we’ll see plenty of examples.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstractly, though, when we see tiles in Hoon peer at them through our rapidly fading 20th-century programming spectacles, what we see looks a heck of a lot like a &lt;em&gt;type declaration&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But no. Just as a gate is not a lambda, a tile is not a type. And worse - we’ve already used the word &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; for something else. And worst of all - each tile corresponds to a well-defined type, called its &lt;em&gt;icon&lt;/em&gt;. But tile and icon are not in any way the same noun. You can see the potential confusion&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tile is actually two steps away from being a type, in the strict sense of &lt;code&gt;++type&lt;/code&gt;. The tile is converted statically into a twig, which in turn may (depending on the conversion) produce the icon, test for it, etc. And always, the icon is some function of the tile and its subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, even the most experienced Hoon programmers can be heard saying “type” when they mean “tile.” Apparently you can take the boy out of the ’90s but not the ’90s out of the boy. In fact, it’s tempting to suggest that if there’s one problem with 20th-century programming in general, it’s that it doesn’t know the difference between a tile and its icon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine, for instance, a C++ in which the class definition and the constructor are the same thing. And the latter can also validate untrusted data off the Internets, acting much as for instance an XML DTD. Yo, why would you have a type system and not be able to do this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reductions&quot;&gt;Reductions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadly speaking, a tile is a &lt;em&gt;convenient way of making a well-typed noun&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that tiles are really pure sugar. It is possible to build a language like Hoon, but with only twigs and no tiles. However, certain common tasks in this language will always be unnecessarily cumbersome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tile is not a type declaration, but it has roughly the same job to do - and this is by no means a trivial job. So tiles aren’t trivial. Sorry, we wish they were. (Actually we wish they didn’t exist at all, but couldn’t figure out how to swing it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use tiles by converting them to twigs, which produce or identify nouns of a type easily predictable from the tile. Again, there are four such reductions: &lt;code&gt;bunt&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;clam&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;fish&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;whip&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;bunting&quot;&gt;Bunting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bunting a tile - if &lt;code&gt;sec&lt;/code&gt; is a tile, &lt;code&gt;~(bunt al sec)&lt;/code&gt; produces its bunt - makes a twig that &lt;em&gt;creates a blank default example&lt;/em&gt; of the tile’s icon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bunting is actually the most common use of a tile. Consider the gates we’ve just been defining - how do we build a gate? With&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;++  deq
  =+  x=0
  |.  
  =+  y=0
  |-  
  ?:  =(x +(y))
    y
  $(y +(y))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value &lt;code&gt;x=0&lt;/code&gt; is a useless default. It’s in our gate only because the gate is built first, then modified with the real sample. Accordingly, in practice to build a gate we use the synthetic hoon &lt;code&gt;|=&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;bartis&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%brts&lt;/code&gt;), which is defined as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;++  twig  $%  [%brts p=tile q=hoon]
          ==&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;++  open
  ^-  twig
  ?-    gen
    [%bctr *]  [%ktsg ~(bunt al p.gen)]
    [%brcb *]  [%tsls [%bctr p.gen] [%brcn q.gen]]
    [%brts *]  [%brcb p.gen (~(put by *(map term foot)) %$ [%ash q.gen])]
  ==&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The only hoon we haven’t met here is &lt;code&gt;^~&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;ketsig&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%ktsg&lt;/code&gt;), which tells the compiler to compute a constant expression at compile time. Obviously, the default sample in a gate should under almost every circumstance be a constant.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With &lt;code&gt;|=&lt;/code&gt; we have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;++  deq
  |=  x=@
  =+  y=0
  |-  
  ?:  =(x +(y))
    y
  $(y +(y))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or if we prefer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;++  deq  |=(x=@ =+(y=0 |-(?:(=(x +(y)) y $(y +(y))))))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is &lt;code&gt;x=@&lt;/code&gt;? A tile. And the tile in &lt;code&gt;|=&lt;/code&gt; is always bunted to create the default sample.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it’s wrong to say that the default sample is useless. It generates a corresponding &lt;em&gt;default product&lt;/em&gt;. It is perfectly legitimate to simply apply a gate, even a previously unviolated gate, without changing the sample at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, one type of tile is simply a gate. When we bunt such a gate, we have no choice but to produce the default product. Thus any gate arm that wants to be used as a tile has the responsibility to produce a useful default product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;clamming&quot;&gt;Clamming&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;clam&lt;/code&gt; reduction generates a gate which accepts an arbitrary noun and produces a member of the tile’s icon. Ie, &lt;code&gt;clam&lt;/code&gt; generates a validator function for the icon. Perhaps you can see how this might be useful, at least, on the Internets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, a clam for any tile, if passed a member of the type, is guaranteed to produce its sample. If passed a noun outside the type, it will normalize and/or default. It won’t crash - except for the custom cases of &lt;code&gt;%herb&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;%weed&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fishing&quot;&gt;Fishing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;fish&lt;/code&gt; reduction lets us test if a noun matches the tile, with the &lt;code&gt;?=&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;wuttis&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%wtts&lt;/code&gt;) natural hoon:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;++  twig  $%  [%wtts p=tile q=wing]
          ==&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that &lt;code&gt;?=&lt;/code&gt; only works on a wing and more specifically leg - that is, it has to be testing a fragment of the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover - we’ll discuss this in more detail when we get to type inference - when we use &lt;code&gt;?=&lt;/code&gt; in a &lt;code&gt;?:&lt;/code&gt; test, the compiler sees the test and uses it to refine the subject type on either side of the branch. Hence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;?:  ?=(@ a)             ::  test if a is an atom
  XX                    ::  code assuming a is an atom
XX                      ::  code assuming a is a cell&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some languages call fishing “pattern matching.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whipping&quot;&gt;Whipping&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides fishing on a leg, we can normalize any leg to any tile using the &lt;code&gt;$@&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;bucpat&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%bcpt&lt;/code&gt;) hoon - aka, &lt;code&gt;whip&lt;/code&gt;. Not only is &lt;code&gt;whip&lt;/code&gt; the same thing as &lt;code&gt;clam&lt;/code&gt;, it’s what &lt;code&gt;clam&lt;/code&gt; uses internally. All &lt;code&gt;clam&lt;/code&gt; does is make a gate whose sample, an arbitrary noun &lt;code&gt;+&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;glus&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.6&lt;/code&gt;), it whips into its tile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tile_syntax_and_abuse&quot;&gt;Tile syntax and abuse&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A wide variety of twigs contain tiles, but the basic tiling twigs are worth listing in one place, along with their regular and irregular syntax:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;++  twig  $%  [%bccb p=tile]
              [%bccm p=tile]
              [%bcpt p=wing q=tile]
              [%bctr p=tile]
              [%wtts p=tile q=wing]
          ==&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$_&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;buccab&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%bccb&lt;/code&gt;) bunts tile &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$*&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;buctar&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%bctr&lt;/code&gt;) bunts tile &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; and folds it statically to a constant with &lt;code&gt;%ktsg&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$,&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;buccom&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%bccm&lt;/code&gt;) makes a clam for tile &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$@&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;bucpat&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%bcpt&lt;/code&gt;) whips the leg at wing &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;, filtering it with tile &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;?=&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;wuttis&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%wtts&lt;/code&gt;) fishes the leg at wing &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; for tile &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;, producing &amp;amp; (yes) if and only if leg &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; is in tile &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;code&gt;%wtts&lt;/code&gt; looks different because it produces a boolean, not a noun in the tile.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing we’ll see quite frequently is the irregular wide forms of these hoons (in fact, the regular forms of many are rare). Consider the base tiles &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; - ie, noun and atom. (And note that tiles, too, have tall, wide, and irregular wide forms.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; prefix before a wide tile is &lt;code&gt;%bccb&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~zod/try=&amp;gt; _*
0

~zod/try=&amp;gt; :type; _*
0
*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; prefix on a tile is &lt;code&gt;%bctr&lt;/code&gt;, the same thing folded to a constant (obviously a no-op here)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~zod/try=&amp;gt; **
0
~zod/try=&amp;gt; :type; **
0
*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt; prefix on a tile is &lt;code&gt;%bccm&lt;/code&gt;, ie, generate a function producing the tile. Let’s save one of our nouns and make it an atom, using a clam. Let’s try the clam on different things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~zod/try=&amp;gt; =foo _*
~zod/try=&amp;gt; (,@ foo)
0
~zod/try=&amp;gt; :type; (,@ foo)
0
@
~zod/try=&amp;gt; :type; (,@ [5 5])
0
@
~zod/try=&amp;gt; :type; (,@ %foo)
7.303.014
@&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternately, we could check if our &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;?=&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~zod/try=&amp;gt; ?=(@ foo)
%.y&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is all this true? Because the bunt of &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; is the atom &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; with the type &lt;code&gt;%noun&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, if a tile appears where we expect a twig, the normal tile-to-twig conversion is always &lt;code&gt;%bccm&lt;/code&gt;. Ie, using a tile as a twig generates a gate producing the icon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the_tiles&quot;&gt;The tiles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a good general understanding of what a tile is for - we’ll go back into the tiles we actually have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;++  tile  
  $&amp;amp;  [p=tile q=tile]                     ::  ordered pair
  $%  [%axil p=base]                      ::  base type
      [%bark p=term q=tile]               ::  name
      [%bush p=tile q=tile]               ::  pair/tag
      [%fern p=[i=tile t=(list tile)]]    ::  plain selection
      [%herb p=twig]                      ::  function
      [%kelp p=[i=line t=(list line)]]    ::  tag selection
      [%leaf p=term q=@]                  ::  constant atom
      [%reed p=tile q=tile]               ::  atom/cell
      [%weed p=twig]                      ::  example
  ==                                      ::
++  line  ,[p=[%leaf p=odor q=@] q=tile]
++  base  ?([%atom p=odor] %noun %cell %bean %null)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observe that the tile stems are no longer rune digraphs. Rather, a gardening metaphor appears to pertain. Let’s work through these one by one, showing both (regular) syntax and semantics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[%axil p=base]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An &lt;code&gt;%axil&lt;/code&gt; is a simple built-in mechanism for a few basic icons: an atom of any odor (&lt;code&gt;@odor&lt;/code&gt;, or just &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; for the odorless base atom); a noun (&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;); a cell of nouns (&lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt;); a loobean &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt;; and null &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;_2&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[%leaf p=term q=@]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;%leaf&lt;/code&gt; is an atomic constant of value &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; and odor &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;. Obviously its icon is a &lt;code&gt;%cube&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The syntax for a leaf is the same as the twig syntax, except that &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; is never required to generate a cube. For instance, as a twig, &lt;code&gt;7&lt;/code&gt; has a type of [%atom %ud]; &lt;code&gt;%7&lt;/code&gt; has a type of &lt;code&gt;[%cube 7 [%atom %ud]]&lt;/code&gt;. But the icon of the leaf &lt;code&gt;7&lt;/code&gt; is, again, &lt;code&gt;[%cube 7 [%atom %ud]]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;_3&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[p=tile q=tile]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tiles autocons, just like twigs - a cell of tiles is a tile of a cell. But we shouldn’t skip the differences too lightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cell of twigs is also a twig of a cell. But in the cell of twigs, the subject of either leg is the original subject. Whereas when applying a tile in a whip or clam, the subject is split in half for equally obvious reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Otherwise, how would &lt;code&gt;(,[@ @] [4 5])&lt;/code&gt; be &lt;code&gt;[4 5]&lt;/code&gt;? Clearly, this should be the same as &lt;code&gt;[(,@ 4) (,@ 5)]&lt;/code&gt;. Clearly, it should not be the same as &lt;code&gt;[(,@ [4 5]) (,@ [4 5])]&lt;/code&gt; - which would produce merely &lt;code&gt;[0 0]&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The irregular wide syntax for tile autocons is the same as the syntax for twig autocons - eg, &lt;code&gt;[@ @]&lt;/code&gt;, a cell of atoms. But there is also a regular tall/wide tuple syntax, with &lt;code&gt;$:&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;buccol&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%bccl&lt;/code&gt;). Thus instead of &lt;code&gt;[@ @]&lt;/code&gt; we could write:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$:  @
    @
==&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;_4&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[%bark p=term q=tile]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wrap a name round a tile. &lt;code&gt;a=*&lt;/code&gt; parses as &lt;code&gt;[%bark %a %noun]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another case where the tile syntax matches the twig syntax, but only in the irregular form. The twig equivalent of &lt;code&gt;%bark&lt;/code&gt; is of course &lt;code&gt;^=&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;kettis&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%ktts&lt;/code&gt;). But the tile is &lt;code&gt;$=&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;buctis&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$=  a
*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously a silly syntactic arrangement. But you can need it if &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; is really big.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;_5&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[%reed p=tile q=tile]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;%reed&lt;/code&gt; is a tile whose icon contains two kinds of nouns: atoms of tile &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; and cells of tile &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no irregular form of &lt;code&gt;%reed&lt;/code&gt;. The regular form is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$|  ~
    [@ @]
==&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or in wide mode, of course, &lt;code&gt;$|(~ [@ @])&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;_6&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[%kelp p=[i=line t=(list line)]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;kelp&lt;/code&gt; is the workhorse of tiles - it provides the most common data structure in any language, the discriminated union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Hoon, the head (which must be a &lt;code&gt;leaf&lt;/code&gt;) is called the &lt;code&gt;stem&lt;/code&gt;. The tail (which can be anything) is the &lt;code&gt;bulb&lt;/code&gt;. Cases of a kelp are known inevitably as &lt;code&gt;fronds&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Yes. We’re aware that “kelp” is not properly a singular noun. In Hoon - it is properly a singular noun. And that’s that. And oddly, it’s not that hard to run out of four-letter plants.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;_7&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[%bush p=tile q=tile]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;%bush&lt;/code&gt; is a tile in which there are two kinds of nouns: cells whose head is a cell (tile &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;) and cells whose head is an atom (tile &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt;). Its default value is the value of &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t have to look very far to find a bush - &lt;code&gt;++tile&lt;/code&gt; is one, as is &lt;code&gt;++twig&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;++nock&lt;/code&gt;. The rune is &lt;code&gt;$&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;bucpam&lt;/code&gt;). See &lt;code&gt;++tile&lt;/code&gt; above - &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;[p=tile q=tile]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; is the &lt;code&gt;$%&lt;/code&gt;. There is no irregular form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s the use of a bush? Often in a variety of data structures we have something like autocons, in which forming a cell of two instances has an obvious default semantics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, we could attach these semantics to an atom, and just use a &lt;code&gt;%kelp&lt;/code&gt;. In twigs, tiles, or nock formulas, we could have an explicit &lt;em&gt;cons&lt;/em&gt; stem of some sort. But it would be a bulky and annoying pain in the butt as compared to autocons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;_8&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[%fern p=[i=tile t=(list tile)]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;fern&lt;/code&gt; is a non-empty list of cases; its icon is naturally a &lt;code&gt;%fork&lt;/code&gt;. The programmer is responsible for ensuring that the cases are actually orthogonal (unlike with the structured forks, &lt;code&gt;%bush&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%kelp&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;%reed&lt;/code&gt;). A good general practice is to use ferns only with leaves (see below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, a fern that could be &lt;code&gt;%foo&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;%bar&lt;/code&gt; has the irregular form &lt;code&gt;?(%foo %bar)&lt;/code&gt;, or the regular form&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$?  %foo
    %bar
==&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The default value is the first - in this case, &lt;code&gt;%foo&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait. Why do we need these other selection tiles, &lt;code&gt;%bush&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;%reed&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;%kelp&lt;/code&gt;, if we have &lt;code&gt;%fern&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is that tiles aren’t magic. They are really just ways of generating specific twigs that do useful things with nouns. Suppose, for instance, you use a &lt;code&gt;%fern&lt;/code&gt; as a &lt;code&gt;%kelp&lt;/code&gt;. You can do this - but we may well generate more effective validation code for a &lt;code&gt;%kelp&lt;/code&gt;, whose structure we understand how to search for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even if were this not the case, anyone creating complex tiles and icons should use one of these standard structures - simply because it is never really worth varying from this set of patterns, even if small structural efficiencies can be extracted. Therefore, it’s worth telling both the compiler and the reader exactly what the programmer is trying to do in each case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;_9&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[%herb p=twig]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can write your own tile which is just a gate, accepting a sample of &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; and normalizing it as you choose. If you use a twig as a tile, it’s treated as an herb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, when we define a gate like &lt;code&gt;++base&lt;/code&gt;, as defined above (remember that when we use a tile as a twig, we get the clam, ie, the normalizing gate) &lt;code&gt;base&lt;/code&gt; is just an arm which produces a gate. Nothing has any idea that this gate is built from a tile of its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when we parse &lt;code&gt;[p=base q=base]&lt;/code&gt; as a tile, the parser builds the noun:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[[%bark %p %herb %cnzy %base] [%bark %q %herb %cnzy %base]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, &lt;code&gt;base&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;p=base&lt;/code&gt; is actually a &lt;em&gt;twig&lt;/em&gt;, but this twig happens to produce a normalizing gate generated by clamming a tile. In time this will come to seem totally straightforward, but don’t be surprised if it confuses you now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important thing to remember about &lt;code&gt;%herb&lt;/code&gt; is that the actual twig we provide will be applied when we whip or clam. Hence, arbitrary normalization and/or verification procedures may be part of the herbaceous custom tile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;_10&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[%weed p=twig]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;%weed&lt;/code&gt; is the lamest kind of tile - tile by example. A &lt;code&gt;%weed&lt;/code&gt; is defined by its example twig &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;, which produces the icon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One limitation is obvious - it is essentially useless to whip or clam for a &lt;code&gt;%weed&lt;/code&gt;. Whipping or clamming on a &lt;code&gt;%weed&lt;/code&gt; simply ignores the sample and reproduces the example - as does bunting, of course. However, &lt;code&gt;%weed&lt;/code&gt; remains quite useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The irregular syntax for a &lt;code&gt;%weed&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; prefix - for example, to use a twig &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; as a &lt;code&gt;%weed&lt;/code&gt;, we write &lt;code&gt;_foo&lt;/code&gt;. The regular form is &lt;code&gt;$_&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;buccab&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$_  foo&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Anyone who thinks he’s original is merely ignorant.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(Nicolás Gómez Dávila)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s nice that we got decrement working in the last chapter. But we didn’t actually produce a decrement &lt;em&gt;function&lt;/em&gt;. So, let’s do that now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gates_and_lambda&quot;&gt;Gates and “lambda”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we can hardly stop you from saying “function,” the proper Urbit terminology is &lt;code&gt;gate&lt;/code&gt;. You might remember our discussion in chapter 4. A core is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[battery payload]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The battery is one or more formulas; the payload is any noun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a gate, which is a special case of a core, there is exactly one arm - whose name is &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;buc&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;blip&lt;/code&gt; - ie, nothing. One arm, one twig, one formula. Moreover, the payload is always a cell, arbitrarily labeled &lt;code&gt;sample&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;context&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So - to combine several ways of deconstructing a noun - a gate looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;           glus   gras
          lusgal lusgar
            +&amp;lt;     +&amp;gt;
[formula [sample context]]
    -          +
   hep        lus&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this remind you of anything? I hope not! Unfortunately some readers may be previously familiar with legacy functional languages from the late 20th century. Legacy? Perhaps this is a little sharp - let’s say “classical.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In classical FP, something quite like a Hoon gate is known as a “lambda.” We try not to use this term, really. Hoon is obviously not based on the lambda calculus, and it’s not nice to define other people’s words for them. (This is also why we don’t say “monad.”) But we may slip up sometimes and that’s okay. (We may also get caught with “closure” or even “continuation.”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is a big difference: in classical FP, “lambda” is a fundamental semantic primitive. Since these are &lt;em&gt;functional&lt;/em&gt; languages after all, it makes sense that defining and calling functions would be fundamental primitives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But gates - Hoon’s equivalent of functions - are no more than a design pattern: a convention, and a relatively funky convention at that. Plus some sugary macros that make things convenient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Hoon’s primitives are actually primitive (it doesn’t get much more primitive than Nock), we can combine them to produce not only classic, function-oriented FP, but also a broader garden of funky patterns at the same complexity level as function calling. But different from function calling. What? We’ll see some of these patterns in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we_make_a_gate&quot;&gt;We make a gate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal this time is not just to build decrement - it’s to build decrement &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;. That is, as a decrement function - a gate. If this is called &lt;code&gt;deq&lt;/code&gt; (there already being a perfectly usable &lt;code&gt;dec&lt;/code&gt;) and we want decrementing &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; to look like Lisp:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(deq a)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then we can expect our program to look something like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;!:             ::  To write a trivial Hoon program
|=  *          ::
|=  [a=@ ~]    ::  For educational purposes only
:_  ~  :_  ~   ::
:-  %$         ::  Preserve this mysterious boilerplate square
!&amp;gt;             ::
:::::::::::::::::  Produce a value below
=&amp;gt;  XXXXX      ::  some twig or other
(deq a)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This XXXXX twig, whatever it is, must extend the subject to contain a core which includes an arm which produces our gate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extend the subject to contain a core which includes an arm which produces our gate? Sure:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=&amp;gt;  |%
    ++  deq
      =+  x=0
      |.  =+  y=0
          |-  ?:  =(x +(y))
                y
              $(y +(y))
    --
(deq a)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or more conveniently:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=&amp;lt;  (deq a)
|%
++  deq
  =+  x=0
  |.  =+  y=0
      |-  ?:  =(x +(y))
            y
          $(y +(y))
--
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;: /~zod/try/25/bin/hec/hoon
~zod/try=&amp;gt; :hec 42
41&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this doesn’t mean we understand it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, we read the last chapter. So we understand how and why &lt;code&gt;|%&lt;/code&gt; turned into &lt;code&gt;|.&lt;/code&gt;, which then turned into &lt;code&gt;|-&lt;/code&gt;. The loop. But this strange beast seems to contain… &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; cores?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we_understand_a_gate&quot;&gt;We understand a gate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course we need three nested cores. Actually, we have a lot more than three nested cores, because the subject we are getting for the application contains all of &lt;code&gt;zuse.hoon&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;hoon.hoon&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A stack of cores in which the core below is the context of the one above, all the way down to the innermost core whose payload is a simple constant (for &lt;code&gt;hoon.hoon&lt;/code&gt;, always the Kelvin version) is called, for obvious reasons, a &lt;code&gt;reef&lt;/code&gt;. With our three cores, we are adding no more than a few decorative polyps to our reef.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, we can just as well use the standard decrement, &lt;code&gt;dec&lt;/code&gt; - it’s in there too:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=&amp;lt;  (dec a)
|%
++  deq
  =+  x=0
  |.  
  =+  y=0
  |-  
  ?:  =(x +(y))
    y
  $(y +(y))
--
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(We’ve used a more conservative indentation here - uglier and less compact, but arguably clearer.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We define &lt;code&gt;deq&lt;/code&gt;, but we seem to be able to just call &lt;code&gt;dec&lt;/code&gt;. Why? Because we read past cores which don’t bind the arm we’re looking for, we can read all the way to the deepest layer in the Hoon 164 reef - which contains the official, original &lt;code&gt;dec&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(It remains important not to profoundly abuse this magic power. Every layer of core you add, of course, puts you farther from some of the gates you want to use. A smart interpreter can smooth over this issue a little, but smart isn’t free either.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, it should be perfectly clear what the three &lt;code&gt;bar&lt;/code&gt; runes - implying three cores - mean. First, we have the &lt;code&gt;|%&lt;/code&gt; which contains &lt;code&gt;++deq&lt;/code&gt;. (When referring to an arm in informal text, we use this syntax, though the actual language of course requires a double space - when searching in a file, “++ arm” will always find the definition of &lt;code&gt;arm&lt;/code&gt; and nothing else.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This outer core defines &lt;em&gt;the library our decrement gate is in&lt;/em&gt;. Actually, “library” (or &lt;code&gt;book&lt;/code&gt; - defined as a core which contains only code and constant data) is not quite the right terminology here. Even though we don’t use it and it shouldn’t in fact be there, the payload of this core contains dynamic information such as &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In actual fact our nascent integer math library is really an “object” or &lt;code&gt;cart&lt;/code&gt; - ie, a core containing dynamic state. This is just wrong and we’ll see later on how to do it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in every core, the subject of every arm is the core itself. Naturally, the &lt;code&gt;|%&lt;/code&gt; twig uses its own subject as the payload, creating the familiar reef effect as the stack of cores piles up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this library is the &lt;code&gt;context&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;+&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;gras&lt;/code&gt;) of our gate. Thus, the twig in the gate can use anything in the library - of course as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;sample&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;+&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;glus&lt;/code&gt;) of our gate is simply any default noun for the type we want to compute on. Remember, of course, that the whole point of gates is that we change the sample, then compute the formula. Hoon is a typed language, so the sample can be safely replaced by any noun in the same type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within &lt;code&gt;=+&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;tislus&lt;/code&gt;, the old subject becomes the context, and the new subject adds the sample &lt;code&gt;^=(b 0)&lt;/code&gt;. This pair of sample and context then becomes the payload within &lt;code&gt;|.&lt;/code&gt; Hence, we build a gate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, within this gate - the third core is the decrement loop itself, as we built it in the last chapter. Note that if decrement did not need a counter variable or other incremental state, we would need only two cores - we could recurse through the decrement gate itself. We’ll see this in a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s eschew synthetic runes and show the three cores as they really are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=&amp;lt;  (deq a)
|%
++  deq
  =+  x=0
  |%  
  ++  $
    =+  y=0
    =&amp;lt;  $
    |%  
    ++  $
      ?:  =(x +(y))
        y
      $(y +(y))
    --
  --
--
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if we don’t mind synthetics and lots of parentheses, our decrement gate can also be a one-liner. This is perfectly legitimate Hoon style:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
|%  ++  deq  =+(x=0 |.(=+(y=0 |-(?:(=(x +(y)) y $(y +(y)))))))
--
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;we_call_a_gate&quot;&gt;We call a gate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that we’ve still totally failed to explain &lt;code&gt;(deq a)&lt;/code&gt;. This is obviously an irregular form. Let’s try to turn it back into natural hoons, and figure out what it’s doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that &lt;code&gt;deq&lt;/code&gt; builds a gate. We already know how to change the sample, &lt;code&gt;+&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;glus&lt;/code&gt;, in that gate. So let’s drag it out and do it the ugly way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=&amp;lt;  =+  foo=deq             ::  create the gate
    =+  bar=foo(+&amp;lt; a)       ::  replace its sample
    $.bar                   ::  invoke the gate
|%
++  deq
  =+  x=0
  |.  =+  y=0
      |-  ?:  =(x +(y))
            y
          $(y +(y))
--
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this work? It’s always nice to check&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;: /~zod/try/28/bin/hec/hoon
~zod/try=&amp;gt; :hec 42
41&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t actually need a separate &lt;code&gt;bar&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=&amp;lt;  =+  foo=deq             ::  create the gate
    $.foo(+&amp;lt; a)             ::  replace the sample and invoke
|%
++  deq
  =+  x=0
  |.  =+  y=0
      |-  ?:  =(x +(y))
            y
          $(y +(y))
--
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what we’d actually like to be able to get away with is… something that &lt;em&gt;won’t&lt;/em&gt; work - but that looks like it might:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=&amp;lt;  $.deq(+&amp;lt; a)             ::  create, replace and invoke
|%
++  deq
  =+  x=0
  |.  =+  y=0
      |-  ?:  =(x +(y))
            y
          $(y +(y))
--
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We try it and - doh!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;: /~zod/try/31/bin/hec/hoon
~zod/try=&amp;gt; :hec 42
! /~zod/hec/bin/~2014.1.13..22.55.29..8975/try:&amp;lt;[2 1].[23 3]&amp;gt;
! /~zod/hec/bin/~2014.1.13..22.55.29..8975/try:&amp;lt;[3 1].[23 3]&amp;gt;
! /~zod/hec/bin/~2014.1.13..22.55.29..8975/try:&amp;lt;[4 1].[23 3]&amp;gt;
! /~zod/hec/bin/~2014.1.13..22.55.29..8975/try:&amp;lt;[4 8].[23 3]&amp;gt;
! /~zod/hec/bin/~2014.1.13..22.55.29..8975/try:&amp;lt;[5 1].[23 3]&amp;gt;
! /~zod/hec/bin/~2014.1.13..22.55.29..8975/try:&amp;lt;[6 1].[23 3]&amp;gt;
! /~zod/hec/bin/~2014.1.13..22.55.29..8975/try:&amp;lt;[8 1].[23 3]&amp;gt;
! /~zod/hec/bin/~2014.1.13..22.55.29..8975/try:&amp;lt;[8 5].[8 16]&amp;gt;
! type-fail
! exit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This means we had a type failure between columns 5 and 16 of line 8, by the way. More on troubleshooting errors later.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because when we wrote &lt;code&gt;deq(+&amp;lt; a)&lt;/code&gt;, we didn’t mean: compute &lt;code&gt;deq&lt;/code&gt;, then modify the &lt;code&gt;+&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt; of its result to be &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;. We meant: compute &lt;code&gt;deq&lt;/code&gt;, with the &lt;code&gt;+&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt; of the core that contains &lt;code&gt;deq&lt;/code&gt; - ie, with the &lt;code&gt;+&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;library&lt;/em&gt; - changed to &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;. Needless to say, that’s not what we want at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The change in &lt;code&gt;=%&lt;/code&gt; - remember that &lt;code&gt;deq(+&amp;lt; a)&lt;/code&gt; is a short form for &lt;code&gt;=%(deq +&amp;lt; a)&lt;/code&gt; - is always &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the invocation. So we can’t do this as easily as it looks like we should be able to do it - because we can’t edit the gate until we build it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, we have a synthetic hoon to do this. What hoon is (deq a), anyway? It’s &lt;code&gt;%-&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cenhep&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%cnhp&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=&amp;lt;  %-  deq
    a
|%
++  deq
  =+  x=0
  |.  =+  y=0
      |-  ?:  =(x +(y))
            y
          $(y +(y))
--
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at the definition of &lt;code&gt;%cnhp&lt;/code&gt;, our function caller. Here are the relevant clips from &lt;code&gt;hoon.hoon&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;++  twig
  |%  [%cnhp p=twig q=tusk]
  ==

++  tusk  (list twig)

++  open
  ^-  twig
  ?-    gen
      [%cnhp *]
    ?~(q.gen [%tsgr p.gen [%cnzy %$]] [%cncl p.gen [%cltr q.gen]])
  ::
      [%cncl *]  
    [%cnsg [%$ ~] p.gen q.gen]
  ::
      [%cnsg *]  
    [%cntr p.gen q.gen [[[[%&amp;amp; 6] ~] r.gen] ~]]
  ::
      [%cntr *]
    :+  %tsls
      q.gen
    :+  %cnts
      (weld p.gen `wing`[[~ 2] ~])
    (turn r.gen |=([p=wing q=twig] [p [%tsgr [~ 3] q]]))
  ==&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re not expected to understand this. At least, not yet. But we see that &lt;code&gt;%-&lt;/code&gt;, so far from being a primitive, actually is a special case of &lt;code&gt;%:&lt;/code&gt;, which is a special case of &lt;code&gt;%~&lt;/code&gt;, which is a special case of &lt;code&gt;%*&lt;/code&gt;, which seems to do… something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which probably makes you think &lt;code&gt;%cnhp&lt;/code&gt; is insanely complicated. Actually it just shows what an interesting family of things which are like function calls, but which are not function calls, we have here in Hoon. Defining &lt;code&gt;%cnhp&lt;/code&gt; this way saves code, but it doesn’t help us understand the humble function call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we just wanted %cnhp to be simple, we’d define it this way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;++  twig
  |%  [%cnhp p=twig q=twig]
  ==

++  open
  ^-  twig
  ?-    gen
      [%cnhp *]
    :+  %tsls  q.gen
    :+  %tsgl  [%cnzy %$]
    [%cnhp [[%&amp;amp; 2] ~] [[[%&amp;amp; 6] ~] [%tsgl [~ 3] p.gen]] ~]
  ==&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also is not terribly readable. Let’s translate it into the code that we’d write if we were writing this macro out by hand:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=&amp;lt;  =+  deq               ::  create the gate
    $.-(+&amp;lt; =&amp;gt;(+ a))       ::  replace the sample and invoke
|%
++  deq
  =+  x=0
  |.  =+  y=0
      |-  ?:  =(x +(y))
            y
          $(y +(y))
--
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare this to the working example above. The main difference is that this is what a Lisp fan would call a “hygienic macro.” It does not create private symbols of its own, or if it does they are not visible to the programmer. For instance, when we write&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;=+  deq&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;instead of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;=+  foo=deq&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we see how wrong it is to think of the latter as “declaring a variable &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; and assigning it to &lt;code&gt;deq&lt;/code&gt;.” Actually, we have no need within a synthetic hoon to bind a name. After the &lt;code&gt;=+&lt;/code&gt;, we can reach the gate with just &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we cannot simply replace the sample with &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; - because the programmer who wrote &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; meant to write a twig against the original subject, not against the cell of gate and subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, &lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt;(+ a)&lt;/code&gt; gets us our original subject back - and &lt;code&gt;%-&lt;/code&gt; works exactly as if it was a natural hoon. That’s hygiene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sequel_hook&quot;&gt;Sequel hook&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So is this the right way to write decrement (assuming we didn’t already have decrement)? No - there is actually a hoon designed specifically for building gates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The right code (which we saw earlier) is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=&amp;lt;  (deq a)
|%
++  deq
  |=  x=@
  =|  y=@
  |-  ?:  =(x +(y))
        y
      $(y +(y))
--
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this requires us to understand &lt;code&gt;x=@&lt;/code&gt; - which &lt;em&gt;isn’t even a twig&lt;/em&gt;. Rather, it’s something else, called a &lt;code&gt;tile&lt;/code&gt;. We’ll make friends with the tiles in the next chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those with classic FP experience, it’s very tempting to read &lt;code&gt;|=&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;bartis&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%brts&lt;/code&gt;) as “lambda.” I hope it’s clear by now that the difference between Hoon and classic FP languages is like the difference between a bat and a bird. Both have wings and use them to fly, but below that level everything is different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I’ve only been in love with a beer bottle and a mirror.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(Sid Vicious)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;syntax&quot;&gt;Syntax&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is Hoon actually an improvement on Nock? The jury holds out. Here is our old decrement function, from the Nock battery:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ 8
  [1 0]
  [ 8
    [ 1
      [ 6
        [5 [4 0 6] [0 30]]
        [0 6]
        [9 2 [0 2] [4 0 6] [0 7]]
      ]
    ]
    [9 2 0 1]
  ]
]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This clearly it is not for the little boys and girls. But wait - is Hoon any less formidable? The equivalent Hoon twig:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;|=  a=@
=|  b=@
|-  ?:  =(a +(b))
      b
    $(b +(b))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whaa? We can also write the exact same decrement as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;|=(a=@ =|(b=@ |-(?:(=(a +(b)) b $(b +(b))))))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for instance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; (|=(a=@ =|(b=@ |-(?:(=(a +(b)) b $(b +(b)))))) 42)
41&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or even more cryptically,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; %.(42 |=(a=@ =|(b=@ |-(?:(=(a +(b)) b $(b +(b)))))))
41&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I showed this to my daughter, who ran away in tears. Dear reader, I hope you’re not tempted to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoon actually is easy! It’s much easier than Nock. Nock really isn’t that hard itself, unless you want to do something useful with it. But to learn Hoon, you just have to accept that it’s really quite orthogonal to any or all of those &lt;em&gt;20th-century&lt;/em&gt; languages you knew already. Even the functional ones, mostly. If anything, this knowledge makes it harder to learn Hoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mutual hope is that by the time you do know Hoon, you will simply be able to &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; a twig like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;|=  a=@
=|  b=@
|-  ?:  =(a +(b))
      b
    $(b +(b))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and, far from merely able to follow this code, &lt;em&gt;actually observe in your mind’s eye the function itself&lt;/em&gt; - not unlike Keanu with kung fu. You will simply look at this strange collection of squiggles and &lt;em&gt;see decrement&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Our feeling is that the use of reserved words in most languages, by instead activating the verbal lobes, disrupts this sense of directly, or at least visually, perceiving the program itself. If you object that this sounds too much like Science, Science implies testing hypotheses whereas we generally just wing it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of learning Hoon as learning to program all over again. If nothing else, it’s a sort of eccentric adventure sport. Or even a mystery - can a language be esoteric, yet useful? Click here to find out more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;glyphs&quot;&gt;Glyphs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s actually worse than that - learning Hoon is learning to &lt;em&gt;read&lt;/em&gt; all over again. Again, Hoon is a reserved-word-free language - any text in the program is part of the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use so many of these ASCII glyphs that we like to be able to read them out loud. A language is meant to be &lt;em&gt;said&lt;/em&gt;. The squiggles have conventional names, sort of, some of them easy to say, others not so much. So we’ve renamed them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ace  space      gal  &amp;lt;          per  )
bar  |          gar  &amp;gt;          sel  [
bas  \          hax  #          sem  ;
buc  $          hep  -          ser  ]
cab  _          kel  {          sig  ~
cen  %          ker  }          soq  &amp;#39;
col  :          ket  ^          tar  *
com  ,          lus  +          tec  `
doq  &amp;quot;          pam  &amp;amp;          tis  =
dot  .          pat  @          wut  ?
fas  /          pel  (          zap  !&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You just have to memorize these names. Sorry. We accept that they are vile, barbaric and loathsome. So is life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;runes&quot;&gt;Runes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But is this at least enough symbols? Alas, nowhere near. ASCII’s glyph supply is not the greatest, but we can make all the squiggles we need by forming digraphs, or &lt;em&gt;runes&lt;/em&gt;. For example: &lt;code&gt;bartis&lt;/code&gt;, ie, &lt;code&gt;|=&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To pronounce a rune, concatenate the glyph names, stressing the first syllable and softening the second vowel into a “schwa.” Hence, to say &lt;code&gt;~.&lt;/code&gt;, say “sigdot.” To say &lt;code&gt;|=&lt;/code&gt;, say “bartis.” Which has an inevitable tendency to turn into “barts” - a sin to be encouraged. In any language actually spoken by actual humans, benign indolence soon rounds off any rough edges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few runes with irregular special pronunciations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;--    hephep    phep    
+-    lushep    slep
++    luslus    slus
==    tistis    stet
+&amp;lt;    lusgal    glus
+&amp;gt;    lusgar    gras
-&amp;lt;    hepgal    gelp
-&amp;gt;    hepgar    garp     &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at that decrement twig again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;|=  a=@
=|  b=@
|-  ?:  =(a +(b))
      b
    $(b +(b))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we had to read this twig, omitting the spaces (which only a real purist would pronounce), we’d say: “bartis A is pat tisbar B is pat barhep wutcol tis pel A lus pel B perper B bucpel B luspel B perper.” The authorities would then arrive, and drag us out in a big net. Definitely don’t do this at the airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoon has almost 90 digraphic runes. Worse, “Hoon runes” are inevitably shortened to “hoons” - a ridiculous non-English word due originally to Wallace Stevens, which also has the unique property of reducing Australians to convulsions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this should scare you. First, 90 symbols is not a lot compared to, say, Chinese. Second, hoons are easier than you’d expect to organize in your head, because the choice of glyph is not random. Third, no one lives in Australia and nobody cares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second glyph in a hoon means little or nothing, but the first defines a rough semantic category. These categories are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;|  bar    core construction
$  buc    tiles and tiling
%  cen    invocations
:  col    tuples

&lt;h3 id=&quot;regular_forms&quot;&gt;Regular forms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like natural languages, Hoon wraps a blanket of funky, irregular, easy-to-type abbreviations around a comforting but verbose regular core. Let’s explain the regular core first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider a very simple twig in completely regular form:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;?:  &amp;amp;
  47
52&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We observe the rune &lt;code&gt;?:&lt;/code&gt;, which happens to mean the same thing it means in C. In C, though, we don’t call it &lt;code&gt;wutcol&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(In case you don’t remember from chapter 5, &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; just means &lt;code&gt;yes&lt;/code&gt;, ie, &lt;code&gt;@f&lt;/code&gt;0 in our loobean logic. (&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt; is 1.) So this twig just produces &lt;code&gt;47&lt;/code&gt;, not that it matters.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;%wutcol&lt;/code&gt; as a noun has a problem - it doesn’t fit in 32 bits. Efficiency is important to us, so we disemvowel: &lt;code&gt;%wtcl&lt;/code&gt;. We can find this defined in &lt;code&gt;hoon.hoon&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[%wtcl p=twig q=twig r=twig]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So &lt;code&gt;?:&lt;/code&gt; has three legs: the test, the yes case, and the no case. Again, as in C. But why do we write it in this strange triangular indentation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tall_forms&quot;&gt;Tall forms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When all is said and done, the programmer is formatting a big wall of text. This canvas has a curious but essential property - it is indefinitely tall, but finitely wide. We strongly encourage an 80-column standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the programmer’s task as a visual designer is to persuade her code to flow &lt;em&gt;down&lt;/em&gt;, not &lt;em&gt;across&lt;/em&gt;. The usual way to lay out a tree which does not fit on one line is to indent the subtrees and enclose them in parens, brackets or braces. Which might look like this (&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Hoon syntax):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;?:  {
  &amp;amp;
  47
  52
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoon, like other functional languages, has very deep expression trees. In this simple, classic syntax model, a functional language develops huge piles of closing parens at the end of large blocks, which is manageable but ugly. Less manageably, as each subtree is indented to the right, the width of the text window bounds the depth of the expression tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other languages skip the braces and parse whitespace, using indentation to express tree depth. This actually is valid (but ugly) Hoon:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;?:
  &amp;amp;
  47
  52&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gets rid of the terminator problem, but keeps the width problem. And parsing whitespace is horrible. Whitespace in Hoon is not significant, though its presence or absence is. (Note also that hard TAB characters are &lt;em&gt;zutiefst verboten&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoon notices a couple of things about this problem. First, most Hoon twigs have small constant fanout. A parser shouldn’t need either significant whitespace or a terminator to figure out how many twigs follow &lt;code&gt;?:&lt;/code&gt; - the answer is always 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, our goal is to descend into a deep tree without losing right margin. With the &lt;em&gt;backstep&lt;/em&gt; pattern&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;?:  &amp;amp;
  47
52&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;=+  a=3
b&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we step two spaces backward at each subtwig, till the last one is at the same indentation as its parent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This preserves your right margin in one and only one case - where the bottom twig is the heaviest. For example, if we write&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;?:  &amp;amp;
  47
?:  |
  52
?:  &amp;amp;
  97
=+  35
b&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we see a tree that flows neatly down the screen. It’s obviously much nicer than, say (&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Hoon syntax):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;?:  {
  &amp;amp;
  47
  ?:  {
    |
    52
    ?:  {
      &amp;amp;
      97
      =+  {
        35
        b
      }
    }
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or any similar abortion. But its downward flow depends on the coincidence of the bottom twig being the heavy one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;?:  &amp;amp;
  ?:  |
    52
  ?:  &amp;amp;
    97
  =+  35
  b
47&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To handle this, Hoon has a reasonable selection of reverse hoons, which have the same semantics but inverse order. For instance, if &lt;code&gt;?:&lt;/code&gt; is “if,” &lt;code&gt;?.&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;wutdot&lt;/code&gt;) is “unless”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;?.  &amp;amp;
  47
?:  |
  52
?:  &amp;amp;
  97
=+  35
b&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wide_forms&quot;&gt;Wide forms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observe that in the tall syntax, there are always at least &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; spaces (or one newline) between tokens. Other than this, nothing requires anything to be tall. For instance, it is normal and only slightly aggressive to write:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;?.  &amp;amp;  47
?:  |  52
?:  &amp;amp;  97
=+  35
b&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we could even go so far as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;?.  &amp;amp;  47  ?:  |  52  ?:  &amp;amp;  97  =+  35  b&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few would find this readable, which is why Hoon also has a &lt;em&gt;wide&lt;/em&gt; syntax:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;?.(&amp;amp; 47 ?:(| 52 ?:(&amp;amp; 97 =+(35 b))))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a single line, the parentheses - while a parser could get away with skipping them - are needed to actually read the expression. The hoon attaches directly to the left paren (&lt;code&gt;pel&lt;/code&gt;), and a double space or a newline is a syntax error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The semantics of tall and wide syntax are identical, of course. The choice is entirely up to the programmer. Some languages can be formatted automatically - turning an abstract syntax tree into a tall, handsome Hoon file is an art form. We won’t say a program could never do it - but it’d be work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wide forms are also nice because our immature and incomplete command-line shell can’t process multi-line input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;irregular_forms&quot;&gt;Irregular forms&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a very large set of primitives, neither tall nor wide form is tight enough. If you go to &lt;code&gt;++scat&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;hoon.hoon&lt;/code&gt;, you can see them all, organized by initial character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the place to go over the irregular forms directly - we’ll introduce them when we talk about individual runes, or when we run into them and we can’t go around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;semantics&quot;&gt;Semantics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re finally ready to write our first Hoon program. But&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a_new_testbed&quot;&gt;A new testbed&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we’re going to have to write multi-line Hoon programs, the command line is no longer enough. We’ll need another toy testbed, this one in &lt;code&gt;urb/waclux-tomwyc/try/bin/toy.hoon&lt;/code&gt;. Its text should be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;!:             ::  To write a trivial Hoon program
|=  *          ::
|=  [x=@ ~]    ::  For educational purposes only
:_  ~  :_  ~   ::
:-  %$         ::  Preserve this mysterious boilerplate square
!&amp;gt;             ::
:::::::::::::::::  Produce a value below
(add 2 x)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test that it works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :toy 3
5&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copy it into &lt;code&gt;try/bin/hec.hoon&lt;/code&gt;, where we’ll write our Hoon decrement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;+ /~waclux-tomwyc/try/7/bin/hec/hoon
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :hec 3
5&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replace &lt;code&gt;(add 2 x)&lt;/code&gt; with our decrement twig:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;%.  x
|=  a=@
=|  b=@
|-  ?:  =(a +(b))
      b
    $(b +(b))

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :hec 42
41&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works. But, why does it work? What are these twigs, anyway?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;twigs&quot;&gt;Twigs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have already defined the noble twig - in chapter 5. Let’s just &lt;em&gt;reprint&lt;/em&gt; that text - odds are you’ve forgotten it already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we parse a Hoon expression, file, etc, we produce what we call a &lt;code&gt;twig&lt;/code&gt;, which (if you know the CS jargon) is an AST. A twig is a noun that’s converted into a Nock formula, with the assistance of a type which describes the subject of the formula:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[subject-type twig] =&amp;gt; formula&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But actually this isn’t quite right, because Hoon does something called “type inference.” When we have a type that describes the subject for the formula we’re trying to generate, as we generate that formula we want to also generate a type for the product of that formula on that subject. So our compiler computes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[subject-type twig] =&amp;gt; [product-type formula]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as &lt;code&gt;subject-type&lt;/code&gt; is a correct description of some subject, you can take any twig and compile it against &lt;code&gt;subject-type&lt;/code&gt;, producing a &lt;code&gt;formula&lt;/code&gt; such that &lt;code&gt;*(subject
formula)&lt;/code&gt; is a product correctly described by &lt;code&gt;product-type&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, this works well enough that in Hoon there is no direct syntax for defining or declaring a type. There is only a syntax for constructing twigs. Types are exclusively formed by inference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;natural_and_synthetic_hoons&quot;&gt;Natural and synthetic hoons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, most kinds of hoons are &lt;em&gt;synthetic&lt;/em&gt; hoons - in a word, macros. Synthetic hoons evaluate by reducing to other twigs, eventually down to direct ones. Hoon could do without all its synthetic hoons, though it would be awfully cumbersome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, as we’ve seen with &lt;code&gt;?:&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;?.&lt;/code&gt;, when we compile &lt;code&gt;wutdot&lt;/code&gt; - &lt;code&gt;[%wtdt p q r]&lt;/code&gt; - we turn it into &lt;code&gt;[%wtcl p r q]&lt;/code&gt;. It’s all just syntactic sugar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, at the risk of scaring you further, here is the entire Hoon type-inference function from &lt;code&gt;hoon.hoon&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;++play&lt;/code&gt; is a serviceable list of the &lt;em&gt;natural&lt;/em&gt; hoons - the axioms, as it were. Understand all these, and the rest are just… macros.&lt;/p&gt;

                 ~|(%play-open !!)
               $(gen doz)
  ==&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it’s a little intimidating. But not bad for a whole language, perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by working through the hoons we’ll need to make decrement work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cores&quot;&gt;Cores&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build decrement, we’ll need a loop. To write a loop, we’ll need a core. This adds another to the kinds of types we know:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;++  type  $|  ?(%noun %void)                            ::
          $%  [%atom p=term]                            ::
              [%cell p=type q=type]                     ::
              [%core p=type q=coil]                     ::
              [%cube p=* q=type]                        ::
              [%face p=term q=type]                     ::
              [%fork p=type q=type]                     ::
          ==                                            ::
++  coil  $:  p=?(%gold %iron %lead %zinc)              ::
              q=type                                    ::
              r=[p=?(~ ^) q=(map term foot)]            ::
          ==                                            ::
++  foot  $%  [%ash p=twig]                             ::
              [%elm p=twig]                             ::
          ==                                            ::&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aha, you say. I knew there had to be something complicated in here. Well, fact is, I’m just a simple country mouse and so are you, but Hoon is a polymorphic higher-order typed functional language with genericity and stuff, and you don’t get that without a little bit of urban funk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we want to keep it simple for now, so let’s imagine it said&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[%core p=type q=(map term twig)]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we recall from chapter 4, a core is a &lt;code&gt;[code data]&lt;/code&gt; cell - &lt;code&gt;[battery payload]&lt;/code&gt;. Essentially, an object. The battery, at the Nock level, is a tree of formulas, each of whose subject is the core itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s change our test file to produce a core. The whole file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
!:             ::  To write a trivial Hoon program
|=  *          ::
|=  [a=@ ~]    ::  For educational purposes only
:_  ~  :_  ~   ::
:-  %$         ::  Preserve this mysterious boilerplate square
!&amp;gt;             ::
:::::::::::::::::  Produce a value below
|%
++  hello
  &amp;quot;hello, world.&amp;quot;
--
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The syntax for a basic core is &lt;code&gt;|%&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;barcen&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;%brcn&lt;/code&gt;), followed by any number of arms &lt;code&gt;++&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;luslus&lt;/code&gt;, or just &lt;code&gt;slus&lt;/code&gt;), followed by a terminator &lt;code&gt;--&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;hephep&lt;/code&gt;, or just &lt;code&gt;phep&lt;/code&gt;). The arm is a symbol and a twig. The subject of the twig is the core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s try this puppy out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;: /~waclux-tomwyc/try/9/bin/hec/hoon
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :hec
! type-fail
! exit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoops! We forgot that Arvo is a &lt;em&gt;typed&lt;/em&gt; command-line. Because it’s parsed as an open-ended list, it always has the terminator (&lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;, which is just &lt;code&gt;@n&lt;/code&gt;0) on the end. But it needs an atom:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;|=  [a=@ ~]    ::  For educational purposes only&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :hec 42
&amp;lt; 1.ivl
  1.hfd
  [ [a=@ %~]
    &amp;lt;1.vpy [* [@p /] &amp;lt;218.tvj 18.olk 323.uvl 81.wza 1.xlc %164&amp;gt;]&amp;gt;
  ]
&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a core. Or it’s how we print a core, anyway. This is actually a giant noun full of all kinds of formulas, and it would be kind of lame to dump a megabyte of nock on your screen. The print format is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;number-of-arms.checksum payload&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we wrapped our new &lt;code&gt;1.ivl&lt;/code&gt; core, with its &lt;code&gt;++hello&lt;/code&gt; arm, around the &lt;code&gt;1.hfd&lt;/code&gt; core (which is the &lt;code&gt;|=  [a=@ ~]&lt;/code&gt; thingy), around a stack of cores ultimately terminating in the giant kernel with hundreds of arms (like &lt;code&gt;218.tvj&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay. But we built a core because we wanted to use it. So, let’s do that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=&amp;gt;  |%
    ++  hello
      &amp;quot;hello, world.&amp;quot;
    --
hello
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is this &lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;tisgar&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%tsgr&lt;/code&gt;? You remember Nock 7. &lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is Nock 7. &lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt;(a b)&lt;/code&gt; means “use a as the subject of b.” So, we are resolving the limb &lt;code&gt;hello&lt;/code&gt; against our &lt;code&gt;1.ivl&lt;/code&gt; core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when we try it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;: /~waclux-tomwyc/try/11/bin/hec/hoon
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :hec 42
&amp;quot;hello, world.&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s observe a couple of things. First, an arm is not a method in the OO sense. You don’t see any arguments on &lt;code&gt;++hello&lt;/code&gt;. Rather, the arm is a computed expression - a synthetic attribute, as it were. (Can we build a method? We’ll get to that.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, when we’re searching for a name in a core, we search the payload if we don’t find an arm. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=&amp;gt;  |%
    ++  hello
      &amp;quot;hello, world.&amp;quot;
    --
a

: /~waclux-tomwyc/try/12/bin/hec/hoon
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :hec 42
42
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our command-line argument, &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, is still in there. We can also use it from within the arm. With some string-interpolation black magic:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=&amp;gt;  |%
    ++  hello
      &amp;quot;hello, world - a is { (scow %ud a) }.&amp;quot;
    --
hello

: /~waclux-tomwyc/try/13/bin/hec/hoon
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :hec 42
&amp;quot;hello, world - a is 42.&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, this is a classic case in which the twig needs to be reversed to make it flow downward. We need the opposite of &lt;code&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;=&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;tisgal&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%tsgl&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=&amp;lt;  hello
|%
++  hello
  &amp;quot;hello, world - a is { (scow %ud a) }.&amp;quot;
--

: /~waclux-tomwyc/try/14/bin/hec/hoon
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :hec 42
&amp;quot;hello, world - a is 42.&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;preparing_to_decrement&quot;&gt;Preparing to decrement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do some decrementing, we’ll need a counter. Let’s continue our pattern of using only natural hoons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=&amp;gt;  :-  ^=  b
        0
    .
=&amp;lt;  decrement
|%
++  decrement
  b
--

: /~waclux-tomwyc/try/16/bin/hec/hoon
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :hec 42
0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We introduce a couple of new hoons. First, &lt;code&gt;^=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;kettis&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%ktts&lt;/code&gt; - is a hoon we’ve already seen. We’ve seen it only in its irregular form - not &lt;code&gt;^=(b 0)&lt;/code&gt;, but, of course, &lt;code&gt;b=0&lt;/code&gt;. (Pronounced not “b tis zero,” but, of course, “b is zero.”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve also seen &lt;code&gt;:-&lt;/code&gt; in its irregular form - it just makes a cell. &lt;code&gt;:-(a b)&lt;/code&gt; is just &lt;code&gt;[a b]&lt;/code&gt;. We have a set of these hoons, which let us build cells in classic Hoon fashion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;:-(a b)       [a b]
:+(a b c)     [a b c]
:^(a b c d)   [a b c d]
:_(a b)       [b a]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we might as well say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=&amp;gt;  [b=0 .]
=&amp;lt;  decrement
|%
++  decrement
  b
--
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words - enter our core not with the original subject, &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;, but with the cell &lt;code&gt;[b=0 .]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might remember this as nock &lt;code&gt;8&lt;/code&gt; - and in fact (it is a synthetic hoon, but the compiler sees what you’re doing and turns it into nock &lt;code&gt;8&lt;/code&gt; anyway) there’s a hoon for that: &lt;code&gt;=+&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;tislus&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%tsls&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=+  b=0
=&amp;lt;  decrement
|%
++  decrement
  b
--
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;actually_decrementing&quot;&gt;Actually decrementing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may remember, to decrement &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; we need to count up to it. The first step is incrementing, which we do with &lt;code&gt;.+&lt;/code&gt; - &lt;code&gt;dotlus&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%dtls&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=+  b=0
=&amp;lt;  decrement
|%
++  decrement
  .+(b)
--

: /~waclux-tomwyc/try/19/bin/hec/hoon
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :hec 42
1
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it’s not decrement but it’s a start. What we really have to do is see if &lt;code&gt;+(b)&lt;/code&gt; equals &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=+  b=0
=&amp;lt;  decrement
|%
++  decrement
  ?:  .=(a +(b))
    b
  99
--
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve met a new hoon, &lt;code&gt;.=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;dottis&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%dtts&lt;/code&gt;. It too has an irregular form, not surprisingly different:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=+  b=0
=&amp;lt;  decrement
|%
++  decrement
  ?:  =(a +(b))
    b
  99
--
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And &lt;code&gt;?:&lt;/code&gt; was of course one of our first examples. We can test this, for what it’s worth:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :hec 42
99
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :hec 1
0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it works. For one case of “works.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, gosh, instead of &lt;code&gt;99&lt;/code&gt; - which is obviously just wrong - what we’d actually like to do is, if &lt;code&gt;+(b)&lt;/code&gt; isn’t equal to &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, compute &lt;code&gt;decrement&lt;/code&gt; again, but with &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; set to &lt;code&gt;+(b)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a way to do that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=+  b=0
=&amp;lt;  decrement
|%
++  decrement
  ?:  =(a +(b))
    b
  %=  decrement
      b  +(b)
  ==
--
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meet &lt;code&gt;%=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;centis&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%cnts&lt;/code&gt; - the world’s most important hoon. Actually, &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; that references a limb/wing turns into &lt;code&gt;%=&lt;/code&gt;. Let’s look at its definition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;++  twig  $%  [%cnts p=wing q=tray]
          ==
++  tray  (list ,[p=wing q=twig])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;%=&lt;/code&gt; means “resolve with changes.” If &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; is empty, &lt;code&gt;%=&lt;/code&gt; just pulls wing &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; with no changes. Otherwise, we get &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; with the wings in &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; set to the provided twigs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A wing, of course, can resolve to a leg or an arm - a fragment of the subject, or a computed attribute like &lt;code&gt;++decrement&lt;/code&gt; above. When &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; resolves to an arm, we compute based on the changes defined in &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt;. (When one of the wings in &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; resolves to an arm, the change is to the core that contains the arm.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this should do exactly what we want - it should replace &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;+(b)&lt;/code&gt;, and recompute. But does it? Amazingly&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;: /~waclux-tomwyc/try/21/bin/hec/hoon
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :hec 42
41&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;making_it_pretty&quot;&gt;Making it pretty&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing we notice is that &lt;code&gt;%=&lt;/code&gt; is pretty important, and being pretty important it ought to have an irregular form:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=+  b=0
=&amp;lt;  decrement
|%
++  decrement
  ?:  =(a +(b))
    b
  decrement(b +(b))
--
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second thing we notice is this heavy word, &lt;code&gt;decrement&lt;/code&gt;, which we are dragging around everywhere. Actually, we know we’re writing a decrement program. So why do we keep saying decrement, decrement, decrement?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naming things is one of the most annoying and difficult problems in programming. Nobody should have to name anything, especially if its only job is to call itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, a unique feature of Hoon is &lt;em&gt;the empty name&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;. The character (the dollar sign) is pronounced &lt;code&gt;buc&lt;/code&gt;; the value; (the empty term) is pronounced &lt;code&gt;blip&lt;/code&gt;. So you can say either. Or both - depends if you’re money. Either way, neighbor, &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; has a value and it ain’t nothing but zero:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ux`%foo
0x6f.6f66
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ux`%$
0x0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we use &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; as a name, our decrement gets cleaner - or shorter, anyway:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
=+  b=0
=&amp;lt;  $
|%
++  $
  ?:  =(a +(b))
    b
  $(b +(b))
--
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third thing we notice is that this pattern of “have one arm and do it again with some changes” is… well, it has a name. So we might expect to see a more convenient hoon - and indeed we do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;=+  b=0
=&amp;lt;  $
|.
?:  =(a +(b))
  b
$(b +(b))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is &lt;code&gt;|.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;bardot&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%brdt&lt;/code&gt;? It’s easy to see what a synthetic hoon does - we just look at its line in &lt;code&gt;++open&lt;/code&gt; (in &lt;code&gt;hoon.hoon&lt;/code&gt;). For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[%tsgl *]  [%tsgr q.gen p.gen]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and, more to the point:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[%brdt *]  [%brcn (~(put by *(map term foot)) %$ [%ash p.gen])]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Okay, this isn’t exactly as pellucid as it might be. All it means is that we create a &lt;code&gt;|%&lt;/code&gt; with one arm, our &lt;code&gt;%$&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, it seems like we might want to activate one of these strange repeating computations automagically. Indeed there’s a hoon for that - &lt;code&gt;|-&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;barhep&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;%brhp&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[%brhp *]  [%tsgl [%cnzy %$] [%brdt p.gen]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that we just did that. &lt;code&gt;%cnzy&lt;/code&gt; is an internal hoon which doesn’t have a syntax, and just makes macros smaller:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[%cnzy *]  [%cnts [p.gen ~] ~]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aha, good old &lt;code&gt;%cnts&lt;/code&gt; - aka, &lt;code&gt;%=&lt;/code&gt;. But wait - does it work? We get:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;=+  b=0
|-
?:  =(a +(b))
  b
$(b +(b))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, to indent this a little more aggressively, our final result. It isn’t exactly what we started with - but we’ll get there in a minute:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;!:             ::  To write a trivial Hoon program
|=  *          ::
|=  [a=@ ~]    ::  For educational purposes only
:_  ~  :_  ~   ::
:-  %$         ::  Preserve this mysterious boilerplate square
!&amp;gt;             ::
:::::::::::::::::  Produce a value below
=+  b=0
|-  ?:  =(a +(b))
      b
    $(b +(b))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s try it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;: /~waclux-tomwyc/try/22/bin/hec/hoon
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :hec 42
41&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;exercises&quot;&gt;Exercises&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercise 1: write the entire expression under the boilerplate above, in one line as wide form. Test it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exercise 2: write a Hoon program :fib that instead computes the Fibonacci number at &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://urbit.org/2013/11/18/urbit-is-easy-ch6</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;urbit-is-easy-ch5.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prev&lt;/strong&gt;: Intro To Hoon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;urbit-is-easy-ch7.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt;: Hoon Computes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What good is a phone call if you’re unable to speak?”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(The Matrix)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;more_simple_types&quot;&gt;More simple types&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we actually do some programming with Hoon, let’s meet two more kinds of type - &lt;code&gt;%face&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;%fork&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;++  type  $|  ?(%noun %void)
          $%  [%atom p=term]
              [%cell p=type q=type]
              [%cube p=* q=type]  
              [%face p=term q=type]
              [%fork p=type q=type]
          ==&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;%fork&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;%fork&lt;/code&gt; is simply a union type. A type is a set of nouns - &lt;code&gt;[%fork p q]&lt;/code&gt; means “it could be a p, or maybe a q.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any branching computation in which different branches produce different types will generate a fork. For example, without worrying too much about the mysterious &lt;code&gt;?:&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; ?:(&amp;amp; %foo [13 10])
%foo
{ %foo [@ud @ud] }

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -:!&amp;gt;(?:(&amp;amp; %foo [13 10]))
[ %fork
  p=[%cube p=7.303.014 q=[%atom p=%tas]]
  q=[%cell p=[%atom p=%ud] q=[%atom p=%ud]]
]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we start to understand why the type renderer is useful, as &lt;code&gt;{ %foo [@ud @ud] }&lt;/code&gt; (which is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in any way Hoon syntax) is a little easier to read than the actual type noun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Readers of a mathematical bent may ask: since Hoon has a union type, where is the intersection type? There is none. Hoon is not one of these languages whose goal is to be as mathematically powerful as possible. Since a programming language is a UI for programmers, and programmers are not mathematicians, Hoon is designed to be as powerful as it has to be - and no more.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;_2&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;%face&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A type is not just a set of nouns - it’s also a &lt;em&gt;meaning&lt;/em&gt; which makes sense of any noun in that set. The typed noun exports a namespace - give it a name, and it gives you another noun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s use this feature:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; foo=42
foo=42
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; foo=42
foo=42
foo=@ud
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -:!&amp;gt;(foo=42)
[%face p=%foo q=[%atom p=%ud]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With &lt;code&gt;%face&lt;/code&gt;, we’ve simply wrapped a label around another type. Note that this doesn’t impair our ability to compute with the value. Computationally, &lt;code&gt;foo=42&lt;/code&gt; is just &lt;code&gt;42&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; (add 17 foo=42)
59&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how do we use this namespace?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To play comfortably with names, it’ll help if we introduce some Arvo shell syntax. As in Unix, you can bind variables in the Arvo shell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; =test 42
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; test
42
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; (add 17 test)
59&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;code&gt;=name value&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in any way Hoon syntax - any Hoon expression is a valid Arvo command, but not every Arvo command is a Hoon expression.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s put a &lt;code&gt;%face&lt;/code&gt; inside this shell variable and try to use it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; =test foo=42
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; test
foo=42
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; foo.test
42&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably expected it to be &lt;code&gt;test.foo&lt;/code&gt;. This disoriented feeling should vanish in a few minutes. Let’s go further:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; =test foo=42
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; test
foo=42
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; foo.test
42

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; =test bar=foo=42
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; test
bar=foo=42
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -:!&amp;gt;(test)
[%face p=%bar q=[%face p=%foo q=[%atom p=%ud]]]

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; bar.test
foo=42
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -:!&amp;gt;(bar.test)
[%face p=%foo q=[%atom p=%ud]]

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; foo.bar.test
42
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -:!&amp;gt;(foo.bar.test)
[%atom p=%ud]

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; foo.test
! -find-limb.foo
! find-none
! exit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;name_resolution&quot;&gt;Name resolution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re starting to learn a little about name resolution in Hoon. We’ve seen that &lt;code&gt;foo.bar.test&lt;/code&gt; means “foo in bar in test.” We’ve seen that faces have to be unwrapped a layer at a time, so “foo in test” is an error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s try some cells:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; =test [cat=3 dog=4]
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; cat.test
3
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; =test [cat=3 dog=[pig=9 rat=12]]
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; rat.dog.test
12&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see that name resolution seeks into cells. This solves one of the problems we had when programming in Nock. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; =test [cow=97 test]
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; cow.test
97
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; rat.dog.test
12&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By replacing &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;[cow=97 test]&lt;/code&gt;, we’ve done exactly the same thing as nock &lt;code&gt;8&lt;/code&gt;. (And we’ll do more of it.) Note that because we didn’t wrap a face around &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt;, we seek into it when looking for &lt;code&gt;dog&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;rat.dog.test&lt;/code&gt; works just the same way. Even though &lt;code&gt;dog&lt;/code&gt; is now at a different axis within &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For reasons we’ll see soon, we often want empty names. As we saw before, the syntax for an empty name is &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; =test $=42
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; $.test
42&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And interesting cases tell us more about the search algorithm:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; =test [cat=3 cat=[pig=9 rat=12]]
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; cat.test
3
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; pig.cat.test
! -find-limb.pig
! find-none
! exit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see that when we search a cell, we search the head first. It is not in any way an error to have two faces with the same name. And in fact, we can even work with this constraint:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; ^cat.test
[pig=9 rat=12]
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; pig.^cat.test
9&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;limb&lt;/code&gt; to resolve is not just a name - it takes a prefix which is an arbitrary number of &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt; characters. This count is the number of name instances to ignore before matching. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; =test [cat=3 cat=[pig=9 rat=12] cat=42]
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; ^^cat.test
42&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re actually ready to describe the full resolution model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wing_resolution&quot;&gt;Wing resolution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;wing&lt;/code&gt; is a dot-separated list, reading outside to in from right to left. Each element is a &lt;code&gt;limb&lt;/code&gt;. We’ve seen one kind of limb - the name, with &lt;code&gt;^&lt;/code&gt; prefixes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we can also use axes directly from Hoon. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; =test [cat=3 dog=[pig=9 rat=12]]
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; +3.test
dog=[pig=9 rat=12]
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; dog.test
[pig=9 rat=12]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the difference between these two. The noun is the same - they are both &lt;code&gt;[9 12]&lt;/code&gt;. But the type is different:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -:!&amp;gt;(+3.test)
[ %face
  p=%dog
    q
  [ %cell
    p=[%face p=%pig q=[%atom p=%ud]]
    q=[%face p=%rat q=[%atom p=%ud]]
  ]
]

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -:!&amp;gt;(dog.test)
[ %cell
  p=[%face p=%pig q=[%atom p=%ud]]
  q=[%face p=%rat q=[%atom p=%ud]]
]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The axis gets us to the %dog face; the name actually removes it. So we can write&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; pig.dog.+3.test
9
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; pig.dog.test
9
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; pig.+3.test
! -find-limb.pig
! find-none
! exit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is obvious. Perhaps it’s not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;axis_syntax&quot;&gt;Axis syntax&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may seem like overkill. Perhaps it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; overkill. But Hoon has five syntaxes for an axis limb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first we’ve seen already: the axis itself as a decimal, eg, &lt;code&gt;+3&lt;/code&gt;. The second is a simple dot, meaning &lt;code&gt;+1&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; =test 42
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; ..test
42&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, that’s the limb &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;, as applied (with &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;), to &lt;code&gt;test&lt;/code&gt;. Have we gone crazy? Perhaps - but in fact, this one gets used a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we have an list-indexing syntax for constant offsets in lists that (as is the Hoon convention) flow to the right. Indices start at 1. &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; produces the list element, &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt; produces the suffix:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; =test [1 2 3 4 ~]
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; &amp;amp;2.test
2
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; |2.test
[3 4 ~]
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; &amp;amp;1.test
1
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; |1.test
[2 3 4 ~]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mechanism - which essentially just converts the list index into an axis for &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; - is not used much, but nice when needed. It applies only to constant indices, though, which is odd. (For non-constant indices, use the Hoon function &lt;code&gt;snag&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we have a graphical binary syntax which reads from left to right, alternating the pairs &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to mean head and tail respectively. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; =test [[[8 9] [10 11]] [12 13] 14 30 31]
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -.test
[[8 9] 10 11]
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; +.test
[[12 13] 14 30 31]
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -&amp;lt;.test
[8 9]
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; +&amp;gt;.test
[14 30 31]
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; +&amp;gt;-.test
14
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -&amp;gt;-.test
10
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; +&amp;gt;+&amp;lt;.test
30&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alternating glyphs create pleasant graphical patterns which are moderately memorable when used in moderation. Of course, in general, when we have names we should use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;resolving_forks&quot;&gt;Resolving forks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What happens when we resolve a name in a fork? Yikes. The general principle is that name resolution across a fork works if, and only if, the names resolve to the same axis on both branches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; =test ?:(&amp;amp; [pig=3 dog=4] [pig=%pig dog=%dog cat=%cat])
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -:!&amp;gt;(test)
[ %fork
    p
  [ %cell
    p=[%face p=%pig q=[%atom p=%ud]]
    q=[%face p=%dog q=[%atom p=%ud]]
  ]
    q
  [ %cell
    p=[%face p=%pig q=[%cube p=6.777.200 q=[%atom p=%tas]]]
      q
    [ %cell
      p=[%face p=%dog q=[%cube p=6.778.724 q=[%atom p=%tas]]]
      q=[%face p=%cat q=[%cube p=7.627.107 q=[%atom p=%tas]]]
    ]
  ]
]
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; pig.test
3
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -:!&amp;gt;(pig.test)
[%fork p=[%atom p=%ud] q=[%cube p=6.777.200 q=[%atom p=%tas]]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; dog.test
! -find-limb.dog
! find-fork
! exit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Because &lt;code&gt;dog&lt;/code&gt; is at &lt;code&gt;+3&lt;/code&gt; on one side of the fork, &lt;code&gt;+6&lt;/code&gt; on the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve left only one major kind of type undefined - the mysterious, frightening &lt;code&gt;%core&lt;/code&gt;. We made a core in Nock, but that was a little while ago. We’ll explain them in Hoon when we make one.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://urbit.org/2013/11/18/urbit-is-easy-ch5</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;urbit-is-easy-ch4.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prev&lt;/strong&gt;: Using Nock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;urbit-is-easy-ch6.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt;: Moar Hoon Types&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Like all men in Babylon, I have been proconsul; like all, a slave.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(The Lottery in Babylon)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;principles_of_type&quot;&gt;Principles of type&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By working through the Nock tutorial, you’ve actually come closer than you know to knowing Hoon. Hoon is actually not much more than a fancy wrapper around Nock. People who know C can think of Hoon as the C to Urbit’s Nock - just a sprinkling of syntax, wrapped around machine code and memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, it’s easy to imagine how instead of calculating tree axes by hand, we could actually assign &lt;em&gt;names&lt;/em&gt; to different parts of the tree - and those names would stay the same as we pushed more data on the subject. It can’t hurt to dream, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way we’re going to do this is by associating something called a &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; with the subject. You may have heard of types before. Technically, Hoon is a statically typed language, which just means that the type isn’t a part of your program: it’s just a piece of data the compiler keeps around as it turns your Hoon into Nock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some languages, especially functional languages, types are dangerous scary concepts that involve a lot of math. For those who like this sort of thing, that’s the sort of thing they like. For the rest of us, there’s Hoon. It’s a functional language, but not one of those scary ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of other languages use dynamic types, in which the type of a value is carried along with the data as you use it. Even languages like Lisp, which are nominally typeless, look rather typed from the Hoon perspective. For example, a Lisp atom knows dynamically whether it’s a symbol or an integer. A Hoon atom is just a Nock atom, which is just a number. So without a static type, Hoon doesn’t even know how to print an atom properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we parse a Hoon expression, file, etc, we produce what we call a &lt;code&gt;twig&lt;/code&gt;, which (if you know the CS jargon) is an AST. A twig is a noun that’s converted into a Nock formula, with the assistance of a type which describes the subject of the formula:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[subject-type twig] =&amp;gt; formula&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But actually this isn’t quite right, because Hoon does something called “type inference.” When we have a type that describes the subject for the formula we’re trying to generate, as we generate that formula we want to also generate a type for the product of that formula on that subject. So our compiler computes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[subject-type twig] =&amp;gt; [product-type formula]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as &lt;code&gt;subject-type&lt;/code&gt; is a correct description of some subject, you can take any twig and compile it against &lt;code&gt;subject-type&lt;/code&gt;, producing a &lt;code&gt;formula&lt;/code&gt; such that &lt;code&gt;*(subject
formula)&lt;/code&gt; is a product correctly described by &lt;code&gt;product-type&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, this works well enough that in Hoon there is no direct syntax for defining or declaring a type. There is only a syntax for constructing twigs. Types are always produced by inference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;printing_types&quot;&gt;Printing types&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start looking at types with the simplest possible kind of hoon - an atomic constant, which ignores the subject and its type, and just produces its own subject. Here’s everyone’s favorite atomic constant:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; 42
42&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s also print its type - in two different ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; 42
42
@ud

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -:!&amp;gt;(42)
[%atom p=&amp;#39;ud&amp;#39;]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;W-what? Since types are of course static, printing them out dynamically involves a little bit of black magic at the Hoon and/or Arvo levels. All will be revealed in due course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a type, like everything else in Hoon, is a noun. Suffice it to say that &lt;code&gt;-:!&amp;gt;(42)&lt;/code&gt; is just printing this noun, whereas &lt;code&gt;:type; 42&lt;/code&gt; is rendering it intelligently as a string. In this case, the rendering is actually Hoon syntax, but in general it’s just a string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, looking directly at the type noun is preferable. But for a core, the type actually contains the entire codebase. For example, if you type&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -:!&amp;gt;(&amp;quot;string&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you’ll have to press ^C to rescue yourself, or wait until you’ve printed out more or less the entire Arvo kernel. Black magic is evil magic - it must exact its evil price. But someday, you’ll be more the sorcerer and less his apprentice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;atom_examples&quot;&gt;Atom examples&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at some more of these atoms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; 0x42
0x42
@ux

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; &amp;#39;foo&amp;#39;
&amp;#39;foo&amp;#39;
@ta

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; ~2013.12.6
~2013.12.6
@da

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; .127.0.0.1
.127.0.0.1
@if

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; ~m45
~m45
@dr

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; `@da`(add ~2013.12.6 ~m45)
~2013.12.6..00.45.00
@da&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, we got a little out of control with that last one. But the point should be clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note again that there is no dynamic type here. All these values are atoms. Let’s cast them all to decimals to see (don’t worry about the cast syntax - we’ll cover that later):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ud`0x42
66
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ud`&amp;#39;foo&amp;#39;
7.303.014
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ud`.127.0.0.1
2.130.706.433
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ud`~2013.12.6
170.141.184.500.724.667.905.957.736.036.171.776.000
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ud`~m45
49.806.208.999.015.789.363.200&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Yes, 45 minutes is actually quite a large number when your unit of time is 2^-64 seconds.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are these atoms, anyway? Let’s look at the actual type noun (which, without magic, exists only at compile time):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -:!&amp;gt;(42)
[%atom p=&amp;#39;ud&amp;#39;]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; is called the &lt;code&gt;odor&lt;/code&gt; of the atom. In this case, it’s &lt;code&gt;&amp;#39;ud&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;, ie, unsigned decimal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ud`&amp;#39;ud&amp;#39;
25.717&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s an unsigned-decimal interpretation of the atom ‘ud’, which without a cast is an atom of odor &lt;code&gt;@ta&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; &amp;#39;ud&amp;#39;
&amp;#39;ud&amp;#39;
@ta

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -:!&amp;gt;(&amp;#39;ud&amp;#39;)
[%atom p=&amp;#39;ta&amp;#39;]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case this is at all mysterious, we note:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; (add &amp;#39;u&amp;#39; (mul 256 &amp;#39;d&amp;#39;))
25.717&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a general convention, when we represent UTF-8/ASCII text as an atom, we store it LSB first. A text atom is generally called a &lt;code&gt;cord&lt;/code&gt;; if it is ASCII only, a &lt;code&gt;span&lt;/code&gt;; if it is ASCII restricted to the Hoon symbol subset (lowercase with hyphens), a &lt;code&gt;term&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the_logic_of_smell&quot;&gt;The logic of smell&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is an odor, anyway? We’ve seen that the type of an atom constant gets an odor which is a function of its syntax. We’ve also seen that when we print atoms on the console, the printer is (in some black-magic way) aware of the odor, and can print the atom in roughly the same syntax we originally entered it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoon’s type system is generally strong, but odors are weak. The parser itself will only generate a &lt;code&gt;@ta&lt;/code&gt; for an actual ASCII span, but not every atom is a constant. For instance, consider our construction of &lt;code&gt;&amp;#39;ud&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;. Let’s look at the type:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; &amp;#39;u&amp;#39;
&amp;#39;u&amp;#39;
@ta

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; 256 
256
@ud

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; (add &amp;#39;u&amp;#39; (mul 256 &amp;#39;d&amp;#39;))
25.717
@&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only are we mixing atoms of different odors in our arithmetic, but the result appears to be odorless. It is odorless. But we can cast it back:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; `@ta`(add &amp;#39;u&amp;#39; (mul 256 &amp;#39;d&amp;#39;))
&amp;#39;ud&amp;#39;
@ta&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Hoon’s type system is quite intelligent in some ways, it is by no means smart enough to evaluate your arithmetic and conclude that it produces a valid ASCII span. We can convert any atom to any other odor of atom, without any sanity checks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@dr`25.717
~.s0..0000.0000.0000.6475

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@if`25.717
.0.0.100.117&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It so happens that &lt;code&gt;25.717&lt;/code&gt; is a valid amount of time, and also a valid IPv4 address. But obviously not all atoms are meaningful values of every odor. We’re not going to annoy you by stressing out the console printer with bad ASCII, but we could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(And why do we say &lt;code&gt;25.717&lt;/code&gt; rather than &lt;code&gt;25,717&lt;/code&gt;? Are we Germans? No, but we want all atom syntaxes to be URL-safe. See below.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Odors are a weak type system because the programmer often knows, at a logical level not at all available to the type system, that (for example) &lt;code&gt;(add &amp;#39;u&amp;#39; (mul 256 &amp;#39;d&amp;#39;))&lt;/code&gt; produces an ASCII span. We want to keep the programmer from accidentally using a date as if it were text, but we don’t want to keep her from intentionally converting between odors or ascribing odor to the result of an arbitrary computation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An odor is exactly what it looks like - an ASCII span. This span is a taxonomy which grows more specific to the right. For instance, &lt;code&gt;@t&lt;/code&gt; for UTF-8 text, &lt;code&gt;@ta&lt;/code&gt; for URL-safe ASCII text, &lt;code&gt;@tas&lt;/code&gt; for a Hoon symbol; or &lt;code&gt;@u&lt;/code&gt; for an unsigned integer, &lt;code&gt;@ux&lt;/code&gt; for an unsigned integer formatted as hexadecimal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general principle of type enforcement is that atoms change freely either up or down the taxonomy, but not across. For instance, you can treat a &lt;code&gt;@tas&lt;/code&gt; as a &lt;code&gt;@t&lt;/code&gt;, as in a strong type system; but you can also treat a &lt;code&gt;@t&lt;/code&gt; as a &lt;code&gt;@tas&lt;/code&gt;, or an &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; as anything. However, passing a &lt;code&gt;@t&lt;/code&gt; to a function that expects an &lt;code&gt;@ux&lt;/code&gt; is a type error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the ability to cast a &lt;code&gt;@ud&lt;/code&gt; to a &lt;code&gt;@dr&lt;/code&gt; is a syntactic hack; casts in Hoon do not evade type enforcement. When you write&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;`@dr`25.717&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the parser actually produces the equivalent of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;`@dr``@`25.717&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;because we can’t turn &lt;code&gt;@ud&lt;/code&gt; directly into &lt;code&gt;@dr&lt;/code&gt;, but we can turn &lt;code&gt;@ud&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;@dr&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the_smell_of_size&quot;&gt;The smell of size&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides these prefixes, which indicate the rendering and/or meaning of atoms, the odor system has another orthogonal mechanism to restrict the size of atoms. Like the prefix, this mechanism is weak - it is not enforced and trivially evaded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An odor span contains two parts, both optional: a lowercase prefix and an uppercase suffix. The suffix, if present, is a single character A-Z &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; which indicates an atom of size less than or equal to &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; bits, where &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;1 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (c - &amp;#39;A&amp;#39;)&lt;/code&gt;. Thus, &lt;code&gt;@tD&lt;/code&gt; is one UTF-8 byte (whatever that means); &lt;code&gt;@tN&lt;/code&gt; is a kilobyte or less of UTF-8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(It’s easy to complain from a standards perspective that “UTF-8” defines a format for bytestreams, not bytes, and at a strict level it means no more to say “one UTF-8 byte” than to say, say, “one GIF byte.” But odors are not a strict type system. It is possible for a byte to &lt;em&gt;smell&lt;/em&gt; of UTF-8 - or even of GIF.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When enforcing conversions, &lt;code&gt;@t&lt;/code&gt; has no size information and can be used as &lt;code&gt;@tD&lt;/code&gt;; and &lt;code&gt;@tD&lt;/code&gt;, of course, can be used as &lt;code&gt;@t&lt;/code&gt;. But using &lt;code&gt;@tN&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;@tD&lt;/code&gt; is an error. There is no way to generate the smell of size from a constant without a cast. And of course arithmetic results have no odor at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the utility of this mechanism is debatable, at worst it serves as a comment which documents the programmer’s intentions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A full table - for convenience, not because you’re stupid:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;A   1 bit
B   2 bits
C   4 bits
D   1 byte
E   2 bytes
F   4 bytes
G   8 bytes
H   16 bytes
I   32 bytes
J   64 bytes
K   128 bytes
L   256 bytes
M   512 bytes
N   1K
O   2K
P   4K
Q   8K
R   16K
S   32K
T   64K
U   128K
V   256K
W   512K
X   1MB
Y   2MB
Z   4MB&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You of course can build an atom larger than 4MB, though whether you should is another question entirely. But the type system cannot express a size odor above 4MB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;known_and_unknown_odors&quot;&gt;Known and unknown odors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The variety of units and formats which an atom can represent is essentially infinite. The set of syntaxes which Hoon can parse and print is fundamentally limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, Hoon has no syntax which means “number of miles.” But within your program, nothing stops you from using the odor system to distinguish a number of miles from, for instance, a number of kilometers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@udm`25.717
25.717
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@udk`25.717
25.717&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The printer has no idea what a &lt;code&gt;@udm&lt;/code&gt; is, but it knows what a &lt;code&gt;@ud&lt;/code&gt; and can print accordingly. Then, if you have a function which expects a &lt;code&gt;@udm&lt;/code&gt; and you try to pass it a &lt;code&gt;@udk&lt;/code&gt;, it will fail. The feature seems banal, but spacecraft have been laid low by less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is clearly a crude mechanism. If you don’t like it, you don’t have to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;known_odors&quot;&gt;Known odors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoon knows about the following odors, with defined meanings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;@c              UTF-32 codepoint
@d              date
  @da           absolute date
  @dr           relative date (ie, timespan)
@f              yes or no (inverse boolean)
@n              nil
@p              phonemic base
@r              IEEE floating-point
  @rd           double precision  (64 bits)
  @rh           half precision (16 bits)
  @rq           quad precision (128 bits)
  @rs           single precision (32 bits)
@s              signed integer, sign bit low
  @sb           signed binary
  @sd           signed decimal
  @sv           signed base32
  @sw           signed base64
  @sx           signed hexadecimal
@t              UTF-8 text (cord)
  @ta           ASCII text (span)
    @tas        ASCII symbol (term)
@u              unsigned integer
  @ub           unsigned binary
  @ud           unsigned decimal
  @uv           unsigned base32
  @uw           unsigned base64
  @ux           unsigned hexadecimal&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these forms has a URL-safe syntax, which we’ll get to. Each parses as an atomic constant in Hoon, and each is printed by the Hoon prettyprinter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first, a little more Hoonology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the_humble_type&quot;&gt;The humble type&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is a Hoon type, anyway? We know a type is a noun. So is everything. What are the semantics of this noun?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what this highly overloaded word may and does and does mean in every other system of computation that has deployed it, a type in Hoon has two roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One, it defines a set of nouns. Any finite noun is either in this set, or not in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two, it ascribes semantics to all nouns in this set. For example, a Hoon type exports a semantic namespace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this settled, let’s start by introducing, purely in an informal and totally friendly way, the &lt;code&gt;tile&lt;/code&gt; syntax in which &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; itself is defined in &lt;code&gt;/=main=/arvo/hoon/hoon&lt;/code&gt;. This is not the full definition of &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt;, just a simple subset:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;++  type  $|  ?(%noun %void)
          $%  [%atom p=term]
              [%cell p=type q=type]
          ==&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, never mind the syntax. We can easily describe this subset of &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; in plain English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be &lt;code&gt;%noun&lt;/code&gt; (ie, the atom &lt;code&gt;1.853.189.998&lt;/code&gt;). Set: all nouns. Examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; *
0
*

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -:!&amp;gt;(*)
%noun

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; `*`%noun
1.853.189.998
*

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -:!&amp;gt;(`*`%noun)
%noun&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be the atom &lt;code&gt;%void&lt;/code&gt;. Set: no nouns. We can’t show any examples producing &lt;code&gt;%void&lt;/code&gt; - by definition, none of them would terminate. Because that’s what &lt;code&gt;%void&lt;/code&gt; means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be the cell &lt;code&gt;[%atom p]&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;code&gt;term&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;@tas&lt;/code&gt;), possibly empty (ie, &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;). Set: all atoms. Examples: above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be the triple &lt;code&gt;[%cell p q]&lt;/code&gt; (ie, &lt;code&gt;[%cell [p q]]&lt;/code&gt;), where each of &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; is itself a &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt;. Set: all cells of &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt;. Examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; [3 4]
[3 4]
[@ud @ud]

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -:!&amp;gt;([3 4])
[%cell p=[%atom p=%ud] q=[%atom p=%ud]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the_noble_cube&quot;&gt;The noble cube&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s introduce another kind of type here, because we’ll need it to talk about constant syntax:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;++  type  $|  ?(%noun %void)
          $%  [%atom p=term]
              [%cell p=type q=type]
              [%cube p=* q=type]
          ==&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that when we enter an ordinary constant, like &lt;code&gt;42&lt;/code&gt;, its type &lt;code&gt;[%atom %ud]&lt;/code&gt; is the set of all atoms (with odor &lt;code&gt;@ud&lt;/code&gt;, but any atom can have that or any odor). Its type is certainly not the set consisting exclusively of the value &lt;code&gt;42&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here’s how we produce this “cubical” constant:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; %42
%42
%42

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -:!&amp;gt;(%42)
[%cube p=42 q=[%atom p=%ud]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, a &lt;code&gt;%cube&lt;/code&gt; type contains &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt;, a single noun, and &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt;, a base type which provides semantics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Syntactically, any atomic constant can be preceded by &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; to generate a cube. The exception is &lt;code&gt;@tas&lt;/code&gt;, which always needs &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; and is always cubical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;canonical_atom_syntaxes&quot;&gt;Canonical atom syntaxes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s briefly cover the syntax of each built-in odor. It would be counterproductive to specify them exactly here; first, this is a tutorial rather than a spec, and second the spec is the code. For the exact semantics, consult &lt;code&gt;++so&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;hoon.hoon&lt;/code&gt;. Rather, we’ll explain the form and run through some examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If some of these syntaxes seem contrived or odd, bear in mind: none of them collides with any of the others, and they are all URL-safe and more. The canonical atom forms use only lowercase characters, numbers, &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;. A cell form adds &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unsigned_decimal_&quot;&gt;Unsigned decimal, &lt;code&gt;@ud&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsigned decimal is the common or neutral atom representation. It’s not very compact and in many cases conveys no intelligible information at all, but it’s impossible to screw up. &lt;code&gt;@ud&lt;/code&gt; is the default print format for both &lt;code&gt;@u&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt; - ie, unsigned numbers with no printing preference, and opaque atoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoon’s unsigned decimal format is the normal Continental syntax. It differs from the Anglo-American only in the use of periods, rather than commas, between groups of 3:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; 0

65.536
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; (bex 20)
1.048.576&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An unsigned decimal not broken into groups is a syntax error. Also, whitespace or even linebreaks can appear between the dot and the next group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; 65.  536
65.536&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unsigned_hexadecimal_&quot;&gt;Unsigned hexadecimal, &lt;code&gt;@ux&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;@ux&lt;/code&gt; has the same syntax as &lt;code&gt;@ud&lt;/code&gt;, except that it’s prefixed by &lt;code&gt;0x&lt;/code&gt; and uses groups of four. Hex digits are lowercase only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; 0x0
0x0
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ud`0x17

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; 0x10.  0000
0x10.0000&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unsigned_base64_&quot;&gt;Unsigned base64, &lt;code&gt;@uw&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unsigned_base32_&quot;&gt;Unsigned base32, &lt;code&gt;@uv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prefix is &lt;code&gt;0w&lt;/code&gt; for base64 and &lt;code&gt;0v&lt;/code&gt; for base32. The digits for &lt;code&gt;@uw&lt;/code&gt; are, in order: &lt;code&gt;0-9&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;a-z&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;A-Z&lt;/code&gt;, -, ~:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ud`0w-
62&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For &lt;code&gt;@uv&lt;/code&gt;, the digits are &lt;code&gt;0-9&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;a-v&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;signed_decimal_&quot;&gt;Signed decimal, &lt;code&gt;@sd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;signed_hexadecimal_&quot;&gt;Signed hexadecimal, &lt;code&gt;@sx&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;signed_base64_&quot;&gt;Signed base64, &lt;code&gt;@sw&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;signed_base32_&quot;&gt;Signed base32, &lt;code&gt;@sv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;signed_binary_&quot;&gt;Signed binary, &lt;code&gt;@sb&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, without finite-sized integers, the sign extension trick does not work. A signed integer in Hoon is a different way to use atoms than an unsigned integer; even for positive numbers, the signed integer cannot equal the unsigned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prefix for a negative signed integer is a single &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; before the unsigned syntax. The prefix for a &lt;em&gt;positive&lt;/em&gt; signed integer is &lt;code&gt;--&lt;/code&gt;. The sign bit is the low bit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urbit dates represent 128-bit chronological time, with 2^64 seconds from the start of the universe to the end. 2^127 is 3:30:08 PM on December 5, AD 226, for reasons not clear or relevant:&lt;/p&gt;

0x7fff.fffc.afb1.b800.0000.0000.0000.0000&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The semantics of the time system are that UGT (Urbit Galactic Time) is GMT/UTC as of leap second 25. UGT is chronological and will never add leap seconds, even if UTC continues this mistake. If a gap appears, it must be resolved in the presentation layer, with timezones and other human curiosities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;relative_date_&quot;&gt;Relative date, &lt;code&gt;@dr&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also nice to have a syntax for basic time intervals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ux`~s1
0x1.0000.0000.0000.0000

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@da`(add ~2013.11.30 ~d1)
~2013.12.1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no &lt;code&gt;@dr&lt;/code&gt; intervals under a second or over a day. Since the resolution is so high, though, &lt;code&gt;(div ~s1 1.000.000)&lt;/code&gt; produces a pretty accurate microsecond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;loobean_&quot;&gt;Loobean, &lt;code&gt;@f&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A loobean, or just &lt;code&gt;bean&lt;/code&gt;, is 0 or 1. &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; is yes, &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; is no:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ud`.y
0
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ud`.n
1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who find this strange are probably strange themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nil_&quot;&gt;Nil, &lt;code&gt;@n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nil indicates an absence of information, as in a list terminator. The only value is &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ud`~
0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unicode_text_&quot;&gt;Unicode text, &lt;code&gt;@t&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;@t&lt;/code&gt; is a sequence of UTF-8 bytes, LSB first - sometimes called a &lt;code&gt;cord&lt;/code&gt;. For lowercase numbers and letters, the canonical syntax is &lt;code&gt;~~text&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; ~~foo
&amp;#39;foo&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the prettyprinter makes an unprincipled exception and prints the text in a noncanonical format:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ux`~~foo
0x6f.6f66&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to be able to encode an arbitrary Unicode string as a single URL-safe token, using no punctuation but &lt;code&gt;.~-&lt;/code&gt;, in &lt;code&gt;@t&lt;/code&gt;. Space is &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;~.&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;~~&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; ~~foo.bar
&amp;#39;foo bar&amp;#39;
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; ~~foo.bar~.baz~~moo-hoo
&amp;#39;foo bar.baz~moo-hoo&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all other ASCII/Unicode characters, insert the Unicode codepoint in lower-case hexadecimal, followed by &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;. For example, for U+2605 “BLACK STAR”, write:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; ~~foo~2605.bar
&amp;#39;foo★bar&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This UTF-32 codepoint is of course converted to UTF-8:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ux`~~foo~2605.bar
0x72.6162.8598.e26f.6f66&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;urlsafe_ascii_text_&quot;&gt;URL-safe ASCII text, &lt;code&gt;@ta&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;@ta&lt;/code&gt; encodes the ASCII subset that all canonical atom syntaxes restrict themselves to. The prefix is &lt;code&gt;~.&lt;/code&gt;. There are no escape sequences except &lt;code&gt;~~&lt;/code&gt;, which means &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;~-&lt;/code&gt;, which means &lt;code&gt;\_&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; encode themselves. No other characters besides numbers and lowercase letters need apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s cast these to &lt;code&gt;@t&lt;/code&gt; to see them quoted:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@t`~.foo
&amp;#39;foo&amp;#39;
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@t`~.foo.bar
&amp;#39;foo.bar&amp;#39;
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@t`~.foo~~bar
&amp;#39;foo~bar&amp;#39;
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@t`~.foo~-bar
&amp;#39;foo_bar&amp;#39;
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@t`~.foo-bar
&amp;#39;foo-bar&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;@ta&lt;/code&gt; atom is called a &lt;code&gt;span&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;codepoint_&quot;&gt;Codepoint, &lt;code&gt;@c&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally when we build atoms of Unicode text, we use a UTF-8 bytestream, LSB first. But sometimes it’s useful to build atoms of one or more UTF-32 words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The codepoint syntax is the same as &lt;code&gt;@t&lt;/code&gt;, except with a &lt;code&gt;~-&lt;/code&gt; prefix. Let’s repeat our examples, with hex display:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ux`~-foo
0x6f.0000.006f.0000.0066

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ux`~-foo.bar
0x72.0000.0061.0000.0062.0000.0020.0000.006f.0000.006f.0000.0066&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;phonemic_&quot;&gt;Phonemic, &lt;code&gt;@p&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen &lt;code&gt;@p&lt;/code&gt; used for ships, of course. But it’s not just for ships - it’s for any short number optimized for memorability, not for arithmetic. &lt;code&gt;@p&lt;/code&gt; is great for checksums, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, &lt;code&gt;@p&lt;/code&gt; is subtly customized for the sociopolitical design of Urbit as a digital republic. For example, one feature we &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; want is the ability to see at a glance which carrier and cruiser issued a destroyer. Consider the carrier &lt;code&gt;0x21&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@p`0x21
~mep&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It issues &lt;code&gt;255&lt;/code&gt; cruisers, including &lt;code&gt;0x4321&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@p`0x4321
~pasnut&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which issues &lt;code&gt;65.535&lt;/code&gt; destroyers, including &lt;code&gt;0x8765.4321&lt;/code&gt; and several successors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@p`0x8765.4321
~famsyr-dirwes
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@p`0x8766.4321
~lidlug-maprec
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@p`0x8767.4321
~tidlus-roplen
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@p`0x8768.4321
~lisnel-lonbet&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, anyone who can juggle bits can see that &lt;code&gt;~famsyr-dirwes&lt;/code&gt; is a close cousin of &lt;code&gt;~lidlug-maprec&lt;/code&gt;. But she actually has to juggle bits to do it. Obfuscation does not prevent calculated associations, just automatic ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But at the yacht level, we actually want to see a uniform 32-bit space of yachts directly associated with the destroyer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@p`0x9.8765.4321
~talfes-sibwaclux-tomwyc-famsyr-dirwes
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@p`0xba9.8765.4321
~tacbep-ronreg-famsyr-dirwes
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@p`0xd.cba9.8765.4321
~bicsub-ritbyt-famsyr-dirwes
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@p`0xfed.cba9.8765.4321
~sivrep-hadfeb-famsyr-dirwes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ipv4_address_&quot;&gt;IPv4 address, &lt;code&gt;@if&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ipv6_address_&quot;&gt;IPv6 address, &lt;code&gt;@is&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urbit lives atop IP and would be very foolish to not support a syntax for the large atoms that are IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;@if&lt;/code&gt; is the standard IPv4 syntax, prefixed with &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ux`.127.0.0.1
0x7f00.0001&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;@is&lt;/code&gt; is the same as &lt;code&gt;@if&lt;/code&gt;, but with 8 groups of 4 hex digits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ux`.dead.beef.0.cafe.42.babe.dead.beef
0xdead.beef.0000.cafe.0042.babe.dead.beef&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ieee_singleprecision_&quot;&gt;IEEE single-precision, &lt;code&gt;@rs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ieee_doubleprecision_&quot;&gt;IEEE double-precision, &lt;code&gt;@rd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ieee_quadprecision_&quot;&gt;IEEE quad-precision, &lt;code&gt;@rq&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ieee_halfprecision_&quot;&gt;IEEE half-precision, &lt;code&gt;@rh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hoon does not yet support floating point, so these syntaxes don’t actually work. But the syntax for a single-precision float is the normal English syntax, with a &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt; prefix:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;.6.2832             ::  τ as @rs
.-6.2832            ::  -τ as @rs
.~6.2832            ::  τ as @rd
.~-6.2832           ::  -τ as @rd
.~~6.2832           ::  τ as @rh
.~~~6.2832          ::  τ as @rq&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Hoon is a Tauist language and promotes International Tau Day.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;transparent_cell_syntax&quot;&gt;Transparent cell syntax&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By adding &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt;, we can encode arbitrary nouns in our safe subset. The prefix to a canonical cell is &lt;code&gt;._&lt;/code&gt;; the separator is &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt;; the terminator is &lt;code&gt;__&lt;/code&gt;. Thus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; ._3_4__
[3 4]

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :type; ._.127.0.0.1_._0x12_19___~tasfyn-partyv__
[.127.0.0.1 [0x12 19] ~tasfyn-partyv]
[@if [@ux @ud] @p]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who don’t see utility in this strange feature have perhaps never needed to jam a data structure into a URL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;opaque_noun_syntax&quot;&gt;Opaque noun syntax&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of jam, sometimes we really don’t care what’s inside our noun. Then, the syntax to use is a variant of &lt;code&gt;@uw&lt;/code&gt; prefixed by &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;, which incorporates the built-in &lt;code&gt;jam&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cue&lt;/code&gt; marshallers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; (jam [3 4])
78.241
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@uw`(jam [3 4])
0wj6x
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; (cue 0wj6x)
[3 4]
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; ~0wj6x
[3 4]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;noncanonical_syntaxes&quot;&gt;Noncanonical syntaxes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are syntaxes for constants which don’t fit the canonical character-set constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hoon_symbol_&quot;&gt;Hoon symbol, &lt;code&gt;@tas&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;@tas&lt;/code&gt;, a &lt;code&gt;term&lt;/code&gt;, is our most exclusive odor. The only characters permitted are lowercase ASCII, &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; except as the first or last character, and &lt;code&gt;0-9&lt;/code&gt; except as the first character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The syntax for &lt;code&gt;@tas&lt;/code&gt; is the text itself, always preceded by &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;. This means a term is always cubical. You can cast it to &lt;code&gt;@tas&lt;/code&gt; if you like, but we just about always want the cube:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; %dead-fish9
%dead-fish9

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; -:!&amp;gt;(%dead-fish9)
[%cube p=271.101.667.197.767.630.546.276 q=[%atom p=%tas]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The empty &lt;code&gt;@tas&lt;/code&gt; has a special syntax, &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; %$
%$&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A term without &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; is not a constant, but a name:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; dead-fish9
! -find-limb.dead-fish9
! find-none
! exit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;loobeans_&quot;&gt;Loobeans, &lt;code&gt;@f&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;.y&lt;/code&gt; is a little cumbersome, so we can say &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; prefix cubes as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ud`&amp;amp;
0
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ud`|
1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cords_&quot;&gt;Cords, &lt;code&gt;@t&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The canonical &lt;code&gt;~~&lt;/code&gt; syntax for &lt;code&gt;@t&lt;/code&gt;, while it has its place, is intolerable in a number of ways - especially when it comes to escaping capitals. So &lt;code&gt;@t&lt;/code&gt; is both printed and parsed in a conventional-looking single-quote syntax:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; &amp;#39;foo bar&amp;#39;
&amp;#39;foo bar&amp;#39;
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ux`&amp;#39;foo bar&amp;#39;
0x72.6162.206f.6f66&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Escape &lt;code&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; &amp;#39;Foo \&amp;#39;bar&amp;#39;
&amp;#39;Foo \&amp;#39;bar&amp;#39;
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `@ux`&amp;#39;\&amp;#39;&amp;#39;
0x27&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;strings&quot;&gt;Strings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Text in Hoon is generally manipulated in two ways, depending on what you’re doing: as an atomic cord/span/term, or as a &lt;code&gt;tape&lt;/code&gt; which is a list of bytes (_not_ codepoints).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To generate a tape, use double quotes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; &amp;quot;foo&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;foo&amp;quot;
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; `*`&amp;quot;foo&amp;quot;
[102 111 111 0]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re getting off the constant reservation, but strings also interpolate with curly-braces:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; &amp;quot;hello {(weld &amp;quot;wor&amp;quot; &amp;quot;ld&amp;quot;)} is a fun thing to say&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;hello world is a fun thing to say&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And they can be joined across space or lines with a &lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; &amp;quot;hello&amp;quot;.&amp;quot;world&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;helloworld&amp;quot;
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; &amp;quot;hello&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;world&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;helloworld&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;urbit-is-easy-ch4.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prev&lt;/strong&gt;: Using Nock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;urbit-is-easy-ch6.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt;: Moar Hoon Types&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Urbit is Easy&#58; Chapter IV (Using Nock)</title>
   <link href="http://urbit.org/2013/11/18/urbit-is-easy-ch4.html"/>
   <updated>2013-11-18T00:00:00-08:00</updated>
   <id>http://urbit.org/2013/11/18/urbit-is-easy-ch4</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;urbit-is-easy-ch3.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prev&lt;/strong&gt;: Nock Is Easy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;urbit-is-easy-ch5.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt;: Hoon Attacks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“But are you crazy enough?”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(Point Break)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;playing_with_nock&quot;&gt;Playing with Nock&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we’re going to actually do some cool stuff with Nock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, we have an entire OS, Arvo, which is built on Nock. Unfortunately, there’s really no practical reason to work directly in Nock when you’re using Arvo - except for learning Nock, which you do once and never again. So the things we’ll have to do are a little bit cumbersome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Arvo is good at is evaluating Hoon. And it’s possible to evaluate Nock from Hoon, much the way you can put inline assembly in C. Through this indirection, we have two ways to run Nock in Hoon: on the command line and via an app file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;command_line&quot;&gt;Command line&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the Arvo command line, you can run one-liners with the Hoon rune &lt;code&gt;.*&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; .*(42 [4 0 1])
43&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;application_file&quot;&gt;Application file&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the Arvo command line doesn’t do multiline input well, and if there’s any hope of writing complex Nock formulas it’s by using plenty of whitespace and linebreaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we’ve constructed a template for writing Nock formulas as Arvo applications. Unfortunately Arvo is a young OS and has no way to edit a file. But Arvo runs on Unix and Unix is a very old OS. Arvo syncs its filesystem with your &lt;code&gt;$URBIT_HOME&lt;/code&gt; directory, propagating changes on either side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume your &lt;code&gt;$URBIT_HOME&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;urb/&lt;/code&gt;, and your ship is &lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc&lt;/code&gt;. The Nock application template is in&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;urb/waclux-tomwyc/try/bin/nock.hoon&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its text should be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;!:             ::  To write Nock as an Arvo application in Hoon
|=  *          ::
|=  [a=* ~]    ::  For educational purposes only
:_  ~  :_  ~   ::
:-  %la        ::  Preserve this mysterious boilerplate square
%+  sell  %noun::
.*  a          ::  Replace the formula with your own
:::::::::::::::::
               ::  Formula: increment
[4 0 1]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the rest of this document we’ll simply assume you can copy boilerplate, and write the rest of the file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[4 0 1]                           ::    bump /1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The pseudocode in the comments is not in any way described. If you have trouble figuring it out, that’s okay, because it should make itself obvious by the end of the document.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Test this by running:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :nock 42
43&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first complex example will be a decrement function. With or without &lt;code&gt;vere&lt;/code&gt; running, copy the template from Unix:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ cp urb/waclux-tomwyc/try/bin/nock.hoon urb/waclux-tomwyc/try/bin/dec.hoon&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, use a Unix editor to change “Formula: increment” to “Formula: decrement” in &lt;code&gt;dec.hoon&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either next time you start &lt;code&gt;vere&lt;/code&gt;, or on your next keyboard event if you’re already running it, you’ll see something like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; + /~waclux-tomwyc/try/1/bin/dec/hoon&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arvo has slurped up dec.hoon from your filesystem. To test it,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :dec 42
43&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, we didn’t change the formula, so it still increments. But it’s a start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;decrement&quot;&gt;Decrement&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only arithmetic operation in Nock is increment. So how do we decrement? The algorithm is obvious: to decrement &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;, start from &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, and count up to &lt;code&gt;n-1&lt;/code&gt;. Or rather, count up to a number &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; such that &lt;code&gt;m+1&lt;/code&gt; equals &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Is this going to be an &lt;code&gt;O(n)&lt;/code&gt; algorithm? It is. How do we compute effectively in a platform where decrement is &lt;code&gt;O(n)&lt;/code&gt;? Gosh, it seems difficult, doesn’t it? We’ll get to that.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing we’re going to need is a counter. Right now our subject is just the atom we’re trying to decrement - &lt;code&gt;/1&lt;/code&gt;, referenced with the formula &lt;code&gt;[0 1]&lt;/code&gt;. Thus, to increment it, the formula is &lt;code&gt;[4 0 1]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s try to put the counter into the subject with one of our macros operators, &lt;code&gt;8&lt;/code&gt;. Recall our revised rule for &lt;code&gt;8&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;34r::    *[a 8 b c]       *[[*[a b] a] c]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The formula &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; is applied to the subject &lt;code&gt;[*[a b] a]&lt;/code&gt;. What is our &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;? It should just produce our initial counter value - 0. So, use operator &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; to produce a constant - &lt;code&gt;[1 0]&lt;/code&gt;. Let’s put this counter in the subject, and then increment as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit &lt;code&gt;dec.hoon&lt;/code&gt; so that the formula reads&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ 8                               ::  push
  [1 0]                           ::    just 0
  [4 0 1]                         ::    bump /1
]                                 ::&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that for these tall bracket structures, the space after &lt;code&gt;[&lt;/code&gt; is essential. Then, you’ll see the file automatically update in Arvo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;: /~waclux-tomwyc/try/2/bin/dec/hoon
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :dec 42&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whoops! It crashed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;! /~waclux-tomwyc/try/~2013.11.26..00.01.38..499b/bin/dec/:&amp;lt;[4 1].[13 2]&amp;gt;
! /~waclux-tomwyc/try/~2013.11.26..00.01.38..499b/bin/dec/:&amp;lt;[4 8].[13 2]&amp;gt;

! exit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did we do wrong? We forgot that the subject had changed. When we get to &lt;code&gt;[4 0 1]&lt;/code&gt;, the subject is not &lt;code&gt;42&lt;/code&gt;, but &lt;code&gt;[0 42]&lt;/code&gt; - the counter is there. So our original argument, &lt;code&gt;42&lt;/code&gt;, is actually at &lt;code&gt;/3&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ 8                               ::  push
  [1 0]                           ::   just 0
  [4 0 3]                         ::   bump /3
]                                 ::

: /~waclux-tomwyc/try/3/bin/dec/hoon
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :dec 42
43&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, at least it increments again. (Constantly readjusting tree addresses by hand is one good reason to use a higher-level language, like Hoon.) But now, perhaps, we can build a decrement that works for at least one input value - &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously at some point we’ll have to build a loop. But for now, all we need is an &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement that compares the incremented counter to the original argument. We know the original argument is at &lt;code&gt;/3&lt;/code&gt;, and the counter is at &lt;code&gt;/2&lt;/code&gt;; we use the if operator, &lt;code&gt;6&lt;/code&gt;, and the equality test operator &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt;. If the comparison fails, we shrug our shoulders and keep incrementing the argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ 8                               ::  push
  [1 0]                           ::   just 0
  [ 6                             ::   pick
    [5 [4 0 2] [0 3]]             ::    same (bump /2) /3
    [0 2]                         ::    /2
    [4 0 3]                       ::    bump /3
  ]                               ::   |
]                                 ::  |

: /~waclux-tomwyc/try/4/bin/dec/hoon
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :dec 42
43
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :dec 1
0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re getting closer. But now, that loop:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up till now, our subject has contained only data. If we want to loop, we’re obviously going to have to bite the bullet and put code in our subject - which will become a &lt;code&gt;[code data]&lt;/code&gt; cell. In Nock (and Hoon) this is called a &lt;code&gt;core&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose we take our &lt;code&gt;6&lt;/code&gt; formula and put it in the subject. Then, with this core subject &lt;code&gt;[formula counter argument]&lt;/code&gt;, we’ll run the formula itself. With this subject, the formula is &lt;code&gt;/2&lt;/code&gt;, and of course the core itself is &lt;code&gt;/1&lt;/code&gt;. So we can activate the core with &lt;code&gt;[2 [0 1] [0 2]]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, since the subject has changed again, we need to change the addresses again. The counter is now &lt;code&gt;/6&lt;/code&gt; and the argument is now &lt;code&gt;/7&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ 8                               ::  push
  [1 0]                           ::   just 0
  [ 8                             ::   push
    [ 1                           ::    quid
      [ 6                         ::     pick
        [5 [4 0 6] [0 7]]         ::      same (bump /6) /7
        [0 6]                     ::      /6
        [4 0 7]                   ::      bump /7
      ]                           ::     |
    ]                             ::    |
    [2 [0 1] [0 2]]               ::    nock /1 /2
  ]                               ::   |
]                                 ::  |&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does exactly the same thing as before:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;: /~waclux-tomwyc/try/5/bin/dec/hoon
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :dec 42
43
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :dec 1
0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But somehow, we feel it &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do better. Why? Because where we do the useless &lt;code&gt;[4 0 7]&lt;/code&gt;, we have a subject containing the code we want to invoke. It’s just that the counter is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to do the same thing as &lt;code&gt;[2 [0 1] [0 2]&lt;/code&gt;, but the subject is not &lt;code&gt;[0 1]&lt;/code&gt;. That would be &lt;code&gt;[formula counter argument]&lt;/code&gt;. We need &lt;code&gt;[formula (counter + 1) argument]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;code&gt;formula&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;[0 2]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;counter&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;[0 6]&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;argument&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;[0 7]&lt;/code&gt;. With autocons, we can just put them together to make a (superfluous) formula for &lt;code&gt;[formula counter argument]&lt;/code&gt; - ie,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[[0 2] [0 6] [0 7]]               ::  cons /2 /6 /7&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we actually want to increment the counter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[[0 2] [4 0 6] [0 7]]             ::  cons /2 (bump /6) /7&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to invoke our formula on this modified core:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[2 [[0 2] [4 0 6] [0 7]] [0 2]]   ::  nock (cons /2 (bump /6) /7) /2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we put this into the decrement, it should actually work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ 8                               ::  push
  [1 0]                           ::   just 0
  [ 8                             ::   push
    [ 1                           ::    quid
      [ 6                         ::     pick
        [5 [4 0 6] [0 7]]         ::      same (bump /6) /7
        [0 6]                     ::      /6
        [ 2                       ::      nock
           [[0 2] [4 0 6] [0 7]]  ::       (cons /2 (bump /6) /7)
           [0 2]                  ::       /2
        ]                         ::      |
      ]                           ::     |
    ]                             ::    |
    [2 [0 1] [0 2]]               ::    nock /1 /2
  ]                               ::   |
]                                 ::  |&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it does:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;: /~waclux-tomwyc/try/6/bin/dec/hoon
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :dec 42
41&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s one more step. Remember operator &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;35 ::    *[a 9 b c]       *[a 7 c 2 [0 1] 0 b]
35r::    *[a 9 b c]       *[*[a c] *[*[a c] 0 b]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; is a formula that produces a core. Then we see immediately what &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt; does: it activates a core, using the formula at &lt;code&gt;/b&lt;/code&gt; within the core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we can rewrite our decrement to use &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ 8                               ::  push
  [1 0]                           ::   just 0
  [ 8                             ::   push
    [ 1                           ::    quid
      [ 6                         ::     pick
        [5 [4 0 6] [0 7]]         ::      same (bump /6) /7
        [0 6]                     ::      /6
        [9 2 [0 2] [4 0 6] [0 7]] ::      call.2 (cons /2 (bump /6) /7)
      ]                           ::     |
    ]                             ::    |
    [9 2 0 1]                     ::    call.2 /1
  ]                               ::   |
]                                 ::  |&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seems to work nicely:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;: /~waclux-tomwyc/try/6/bin/dec/hoon
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :dec 42
41&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are limits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :dec 0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll have to hit &lt;code&gt;^C&lt;/code&gt;, and you’ll see a big ugly error stack. Nock can work wonders but it can’t decrement 0. (Yes, you can build signed integers in Hoon - they are represented as atoms with the sign bit low.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a_function&quot;&gt;A function&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we start to build up toward language-level primitives, it behooves us to do things the way a higher-level language would do them. Well, more exactly, the way Hoon does things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, although a formula defines a function of the subject, a function - at the language level - is not the same thing as a formula. Or rather, the argument is not the same thing as the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, as we saw in decrement, the subject for the loop needs to contain the code itself. If we apply a formula which can’t call back into itself, our ability to loop is sorely diminished. So at the very least, when we call a function, the subject can’t just be &lt;code&gt;argument&lt;/code&gt; - it has to be the cell &lt;code&gt;[formula argument]&lt;/code&gt;, so that the function can recurse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, it’s confusing to say &lt;code&gt;argument&lt;/code&gt;, because this implies a special status for single and multiple arguments. In Nock and Hoon, we say &lt;code&gt;sample&lt;/code&gt;, which is always one thing, but can be a cell for “functions of two arguments”, a triple for three, etc. Eg, the sample for a decrement function is an atom; the sample for an add function is a cell of two atoms; etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a function needs more data than just the argument - it might, for instance, want to call other functions. Where’s it going to get them? There is no external environment in Nock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the standard convention for a Nock function - or a Hoon function - is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[formula sample context]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code&gt;formula&lt;/code&gt; is the code, &lt;code&gt;sample&lt;/code&gt; is the argument(s), and &lt;code&gt;context&lt;/code&gt; is any other data and/or code that may be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a bit irregular that we are taking the external subject and using it directly from our formula. Let’s try to build a function with this convention and call it directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we’ll build an increment function to keep things simple. We actually don’t need anything in the context, so we’ll put 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ 8                               ::  push
  [                               ::   cons
    [1 [4 0 6]]                   ::    quid bump /6  ::  formula
    [1 0]                         ::    just 0        ::  sample
    [1 0]                         ::    just 0        ::  context
  ]                               ::   |
  [ 9                             ::   call
    2                             ::    .2
    [0 4] [0 3] [0 11]            ::    cons /4 /3 /11
  ]                               ::   |
]                                 ::  |&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why &lt;code&gt;[[0 4] [0 3] [0 11]]&lt;/code&gt;? Our goal in calling the function is to take the blank default core we’ve created at &lt;code&gt;/2&lt;/code&gt;, and substitute in the original subject of the outer formula, which before the outer &lt;code&gt;8&lt;/code&gt; was &lt;code&gt;/1&lt;/code&gt; and is now &lt;code&gt;/3&lt;/code&gt;. Around this we wrap the formula from the default core, at &lt;code&gt;/4&lt;/code&gt;, and the (dummy) context, at &lt;code&gt;/11&lt;/code&gt; - that is, &lt;code&gt;/7&lt;/code&gt; within &lt;code&gt;/2&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s fit our decrement into this framework:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ 8                                     ::  push
  [                                     ::   cons
    [ 1                                 ::    quid    ::  formula
      [ 8                               ::     push
        [1 0]                           ::      just 0
        [ 8                             ::      push
          [ 1                           ::       quid
            [ 6                         ::        pick
              [5 [4 0 6] [0 30]]        ::         same /6 /30
              [0 6]                     ::         /6
              [9 2 [0 2] [4 0 6] [0 7]] ::         call.2 /2 (bump /6) /11
            ]                           ::        |
          ]                             ::       |
          [9 2 0 1]                     ::       call.2 /1
        ]                               ::      |
      ]                                 ::     |
    ]                                   ::    |
    [1 0]                               ::    just 0  ::  sample
    [1 0]                               ::    just 0  ::  context
  ]                                     ::   |
  [9 2 [0 4] [0 3] [0 11]]              ::   call.2 /4 /3 /11
]                                       ::  |&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observe that nothing has changed from the way we called our increment function, and only one thing has changed within the decrement formula - the axis of the argument. Now at &lt;code&gt;/7&lt;/code&gt; is not the naked argument to decrement, but our outer core. The sample is at &lt;code&gt;/6&lt;/code&gt; within this &lt;code&gt;/7&lt;/code&gt;, ie, at &lt;code&gt;/30&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a_library&quot;&gt;A library&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frankly, this is getting close to the limits of anything you’d want to do in hand-generated Nock. But why not press on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we’d really like to do is build a library of functions that can call each other. It’s easy to guess that this library will be a core. But what does this core look like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A function core, &lt;code&gt;[formula sample context]&lt;/code&gt;, is a very useful kind of core, but it’s not the only kind of core. (Actually, because the word “function” is too easy to throw around, we have a special name for a function core: we call it a &lt;code&gt;gate&lt;/code&gt;. Compare to “lambda” or “closure.”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in general, a core is just &lt;code&gt;[code data]&lt;/code&gt; - or, to use more lingo, &lt;code&gt;[battery payload]&lt;/code&gt;. The payload can be anything - it’s just data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The battery can be one &lt;em&gt;or more&lt;/em&gt; formulas, each of which is applied with the core as its subject. This is why &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt; takes the axis operand &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;. If the core is a gate, the battery is just one formula; this is the head of the core, so &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not every core is a gate. Suppose we want to build a library? We could assemble a bundle of cores and put it in the context. So, let’s say we need to write subtract, which obviously is going to use decrement. So, the context will be&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[subtract-gate decrement-gate]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait. Each gate is &lt;code&gt;[formula sample context]&lt;/code&gt;. So, because Nock doesn’t do cycles, there’s no way the subtract gate and the decrement gate can each reference each other through the context. It happens to be the case here that subtract needs decrement, but decrement doesn’t need subtract. But we’re not looking for ugly at this point - we know Nock is more than capable of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To support general mutual recursion, our library needs to be a battery in which each formula produces a gate. The context of that gate is the library core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s repeat this again because it’s so important. Our library will be a battery in which each formula produces a gate. The context of that gate is the library core.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s build a trivial library core of this form, with one function, good old increment. Then, we’ll call it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ 8                               ::  push
  [                               ::   cons
    [ 1                           ::    quid          ::  battery
      [1 [4 0 6]]                 ::     quid bump /6
      [1 0]                       ::     just 0
      [0 1]                       ::     /1
    ]                             ::    |
    [1 0]                         ::    just 0        ::  payload
  ]                               ::   |
  [ 8                             ::   push
    [9 2 0 2]                     ::    call.2 /2
    [9 2 [0 4] [0 7] [0 11]]      ::    call.2 /4 /7 /11
  ]                               ::   |
]                                 ::  |&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compare this to the standalone increment above. It’s obviously more complex and it should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, what we put in the library core is not the function gate directly, but a formula that generates the gate. This way, and only this way, we can put the library itself in the context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, what’s the payload of the library core? It’s &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, because the library doesn’t depend on anything. It certainly doesn’t depend on the argument to our application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, now we can’t just call the gate directly. We have to actually build it. So we need another &lt;code&gt;8&lt;/code&gt; to “push it on the stack”, and then we call it with the usual &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt;. Since the subject at this point is &lt;code&gt;[gate library argument]&lt;/code&gt;, the sample we use is &lt;code&gt;[0 7]&lt;/code&gt; rather than &lt;code&gt;[0 3]&lt;/code&gt; - everything else is the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But does it work? C’mon, you know it works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :dec 42
43&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, let’s go ahead and put our actual decrement function in the library. We won’t write the pseudocode here, because it’s an excellent exercise to add it - see below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ 8
  [
    [ 1
      [ 1
        [ 8
          [1 0]
          [ 8
            [ 1
              [ 6
                [5 [4 0 6] [0 30]]
                [0 6]
                [9 2 [0 2] [4 0 6] [0 7]]
              ]
            ]
            [9 2 0 1]
          ]
        ]
      ]
      [1 0]
      [0 1]
    ]
    [1 0]
  ]
  [ 8
    [9 2 0 2]
    [ 9
      2
      [0 4] [0 7] [0 11]
    ]
  ]
]

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :dec 42
43&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, let’s go crazy and add a subtract function, which calls decrement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[ 8
  [
    [
      [ 1
        [ 1
          [ 8
            [9 5 0 7]
            [ 6
              [5 [1 0] [0 29]]
              [0 28]
              [ 9
                2
                [0 6]
                [ [9 2 [0 4] [0 28] [0 15]]
                  [9 2 [0 4] [0 29] [0 15]]
                ]
                [0 15]
              ]
            ]
          ]
        ]
        [1 0]
        [0 1]
      ]
      [ 1
        [ 1
          [ 8
            [1 0]
            [ 8
              [ 1
                [ 6
                  [5 [4 0 6] [0 30]]
                  [0 6]
                  [9 2 [0 2] [4 0 6] [0 7]]
                ]
              ]
              [9 2 0 1]
            ]
          ]
        ]
        [1 0]
        [0 1]
      ]
    ]
    [1 0]
  ]
  [ 8
    [9 4 0 2]
    [ 9
      2
      [0 4] [0 7] [0 11]
    ]
  ]
]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the call to build the gate is &lt;code&gt;[9 4 0 2]&lt;/code&gt;, because the subtract arm is the head of the battery, which is the head of the core - ie, &lt;code&gt;/2&lt;/code&gt; within &lt;code&gt;/2&lt;/code&gt; - ie, &lt;code&gt;/4&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this work? Really?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :dec [42 12]
30&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;exercises&quot;&gt;Exercises&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you actually know Nock now? Well, possibly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good exercise is to add more simple math functions to this battery. Try add, multiply, and divide. One way to start is by walking through the uncommented routines above, putting pseudocode comments on them, and figuring out what they’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computing axes is slightly arduous (which is why we use Hoon, generally). We are torturing ourselves by using Nock, but we might as well use Hoon to calculate axes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; (peg 3 3)
7
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; (peg 3 5)
13&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ie, &lt;code&gt;(peg a b)&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;/b&lt;/code&gt; within &lt;code&gt;/a&lt;/code&gt;. Writing Nock without this would be pretty tough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;urbit-is-easy-ch3.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prev&lt;/strong&gt;: Nock Is Easy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;urbit-is-easy-ch5.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt;: Intro To Hoon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;urbit-is-easy-ch2.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prev&lt;/strong&gt;: Intro To Nock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;urbit-is-easy-ch4.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt;: Using Nock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“You get used to it. I don’t even see the code. All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead.”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(The Matrix)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fundamentals&quot;&gt;Fundamentals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have all the tools, let’s learn Nock from scratch. Here are all the rules defining &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;23 ::    *[a [b c] d]     [*[a b c] *[a d]]
24 ::
25 ::    *[a 0 b]         /[b a]
26 ::    *[a 1 b]         b
27 ::    *[a 2 b c]       *[*[a b] *[a c]]
28 ::    *[a 3 b]         ?*[a b]
29 ::    *[a 4 b]         +*[a b]
30 ::    *[a 5 b]         =*[a b]
31 ::
32 ::    *[a 6 b c d]     *[a 2 [0 1] 2 [1 c d] [1 0] 2 [1 2 3] [1 0] 4 4 b]
33 ::    *[a 7 b c]       *[a 2 b 1 c]
34 ::    *[a 8 b c]       *[a 7 [[7 [0 1] b] 0 1] c]
35 ::    *[a 9 b c]       *[a 7 c 2 [0 1] 0 b]
36 ::    *[a 10 [b c] d]  *[a 8 c 7 [0 3] d]
37 ::    *[a 10 b c]      *[a c]
38 ::
39 ::    *a               *a&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we saw in the last chapter, when &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is an atom, &lt;code&gt;*a&lt;/code&gt; is always an error. So Nock proper is a function of a cell. Informally, that cell is always described as a pair&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[subject formula]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where &lt;code&gt;subject&lt;/code&gt; is the data and &lt;code&gt;formula&lt;/code&gt; is the program. Notice that &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; in the rules above, except 39, is always the subject. So: let’s learn how to write a Nock formula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;autocons&quot;&gt;Autocons&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We observe from the rules above that a formula, too, is always a cell. But when we look inside that cell, we see two basic kinds of formulas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[operator operands]
[formula formula]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An operator is always an atom (&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; through &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;). A formula is always a cell. Line 23 distinguishes these forms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;23 ::    *[a [b c] d]     [*[a b c] *[a d]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose you have two formulas &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt;, each of which computes some function of the subject &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;. You can then construct the formula &lt;code&gt;h&lt;/code&gt; as &lt;code&gt;[f g]&lt;/code&gt;; and &lt;code&gt;h(s)&lt;/code&gt; equals &lt;code&gt;[f(s) g(s)]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, recall our computation from the last chapter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[[19 42] [0 3] 0 2]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;[19 42]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;[0 3]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;[0 2]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;h&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;[[0 3] 0
2]&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;f(s)&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;42&lt;/code&gt;; &lt;code&gt;g(s)&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;19&lt;/code&gt;; so &lt;code&gt;h(s)&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;[42 19]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? We could have an operator &lt;code&gt;11&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cons&lt;/code&gt; to a Lisp veteran, with the operands &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; - so instead of writing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[[0 3] 0 2]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we’d say&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[11 [0 3] 0 2]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But not only is this less elegant, it’s less convenient. Of course, convenience at the Nock level matters little, but we repeat this pattern at the Hoon level - where it’s often more pleasant to say &lt;code&gt;[a b]&lt;/code&gt; than &lt;code&gt;(cons a b)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;basic_operators&quot;&gt;Basic operators&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nock is small, but it could be smaller. If we didn’t care at all about the efficiency of the interpreter - in other words, if Nock was a theoretical exercise rather than a practical tool - we could make do with just the first six operators:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;25 ::    *[a 0 b]         /[b a]
26 ::    *[a 1 b]         b
27 ::    *[a 2 b c]       *[*[a b] *[a c]]
28 ::    *[a 3 b]         ?*[a b]
29 ::    *[a 4 b]         +*[a b]
30 ::    *[a 5 b]         =*[a b]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s run through them one by one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; just applies the &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;25 ::    *[a 0 b]         /[b a]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For any subject &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, the formula &lt;code&gt;[0 b]&lt;/code&gt; produces &lt;code&gt;/[b a]&lt;/code&gt;, which is why&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[[19 42] 0 3]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is &lt;code&gt;/[3 19 42]&lt;/code&gt;, which is &lt;code&gt;42&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;_2&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; just ignores its subject and produces its operand:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;26 ::    *[a 1 b]         b&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;_3&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt; is the only interesting basic operator:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;27 ::    *[a 2 b c]       *[*[a b] *[a c]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we generate a calculation to perform. Given the formula &lt;code&gt;[2
b c]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is a formula for generating the new subject; &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; is a formula for generating the new formula. To compute &lt;code&gt;*[a 2 b c]&lt;/code&gt;, we evaluate both &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; against the current subject &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;__&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt; just apply &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; respectively - that is, cell/atom, increment, and equals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;28 ::    *[a 3 b]         ?*[a b]
29 ::    *[a 4 b]         +*[a b]
30 ::    *[a 5 b]         =*[a b]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;macros&quot;&gt;Macros&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operators &lt;code&gt;6&lt;/code&gt; through &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt; are all essentially macros:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;32 ::    *[a 6 b c d]     *[a 2 [0 1] 2 [1 c d] [1 0] 2 [1 2 3] [1 0] 4 4 b]
33 ::    *[a 7 b c]       *[a 2 b 1 c]
34 ::    *[a 8 b c]       *[a 7 [[7 [0 1] b] 0 1] c]
35 ::    *[a 9 b c]       *[a 7 c 2 [0 1] 0 b]
36 ::    *[a 10 [b c] d]  *[a 8 c 7 [0 3] d]
37 ::    *[a 10 b c]      *[a c]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these cases just resolves to another Nock computation, in which each pattern matched on the left appears no more than once on the right. I.e., it’s a macro. But what do the macros do? Let’s work through them, from easiest to hardest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;_37&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt; (37)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second case of 10 is so easy it’s puzzling:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;37 ::    *[a 10 b c]      *[a c]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For any &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, the formula &lt;code&gt;[10 b c]&lt;/code&gt; seems to be perfectly equivalent to the formula &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;. But why? Why would we say &lt;code&gt;[10 b c]&lt;/code&gt; when we could just say &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is that &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt; is a hint to the interpreter. It’s true that &lt;code&gt;[10 b c]&lt;/code&gt; has to be &lt;em&gt;semantically&lt;/em&gt; equivalent to &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;, but it doesn’t have to be &lt;em&gt;practically&lt;/em&gt; equivalent. Since whatever information is in &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is discarded, a practical interpreter is free to ignore it, or to use it in any way that does not affect the results of the computation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;_4&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;7&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;7&lt;/code&gt; is our next easiest macro:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;33 ::    *[a 7 b c]       *[a 2 b 1 c]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Informally, the formula &lt;code&gt;[7 b c]&lt;/code&gt; composes the formulas &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;. To use a bit of math notation, if &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;[7 b c]&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;d(a) == c(b(a))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s see how this works by applying some reductions to the definition of &lt;code&gt;7&lt;/code&gt;, and producing a simpler definition that doesn’t look like a macro:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[a 2 b 1 c]

    &amp;lt;&amp;lt;27 ::    *[a 2 b c]       *[*[a b] *[a c]]&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

*[*[a b] *[a 1 c]]

    &amp;lt;&amp;lt;26 ::    *[a 1 b]         b&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

*[*[a b] c]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we can write a revised line 33, perhaps slightly clearer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;33r::    *[a 7 b c]       *[*[a b] c]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;_5&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;8&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;8&lt;/code&gt; looks slightly horrible but you shouldn’t fear it at all:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;34 ::    *[a 8 b c]       *[a 7 [[7 [0 1] b] 0 1] c]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this even mean? Let’s go through the same process of reducing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[a 7 [[7 [0 1] b] 0 1] c]

  &amp;lt;&amp;lt;33r::    *[a 7 b c]       *[*[a b] c]&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

*[*[a [7 [0 1] b] 0 1] c]

  &amp;lt;&amp;lt;23 ::    *[a [b c] d]     [*[a b c] *[a d]]&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

*[[*[a 7 [0 1] b] *[a 0 1]] c]

  &amp;lt;&amp;lt;33r::    *[a 7 b c]       *[*[a b] c]&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

*[[*[*[a 0 1] b] *[a 0 1]] c]

  &amp;lt;&amp;lt;25 ::    *[a 0 b]         /[b a]&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

*[[*[a b] a] c]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So our revised rule 34:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;34r::    *[a 8 b c]       *[[*[a b] a] c]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this actually do? Well, look at it. It evaluates the formula &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; with the cell of &lt;code&gt;*[a b]&lt;/code&gt; and the original subject &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;. In other words, in math notation, if &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;[8 b c]&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;d(a) == c([b(a) a])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why? Suppose, for the purposes of &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;, we need not just &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, but some intermediate noun computed from &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; that will be useful in &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;’s calculation. We apply &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; with a new subject that’s a cell of the intermediate value and the old subject - not at all unlike pushing a new variable on the stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For extra credit, a good question to ask yourself: why do we need to write &lt;code&gt;[7 [0 1] b]&lt;/code&gt; and not just &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;_36&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt; (36)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now understand all the moving parts we need to figure out the other reduction of &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;36 ::    *[a 10 [b c] d]  *[a 8 c 7 [0 3] d]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reducing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[a 8 c 7 [0 3] d]

  &amp;lt;&amp;lt;34r::    *[a 8 b c]       *[[*[a b] a] c]&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

*[[*[a c] a] [7 [0 3] d]]

  &amp;lt;&amp;lt;33r::    *[a 7 b c]       *[*[a b] c]&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

*[*[[*[a c] a] 0 3] d]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve assimilated a bit of Nock already, you may feel the temptation to reduce this to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[a d]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;since it would be very reasonable to think that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[[*[a c] a] 0 3]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is just &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;. And it seems to be - given the semantics of 8 as we’ve explained them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s a problem, which is that &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; might not terminate. If &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; terminates, this reduction is correct. Otherwise it’s not. So the best we can do is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;36r::    *[a 10 [b c] d]  *[*[[*[a c] a] 0 3] d]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt; in either case is a hint. If &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;[10 x y]&lt;/code&gt; is an atom, we reduce line 37 and &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is simply discarded. Otherwise, &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is a cell &lt;code&gt;[b c]&lt;/code&gt;; &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is discarded, but &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; is computed as a formula and its result is discarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effectively, this mechanism lets us feed both static and dynamic information into the interpreter’s hint mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;_6&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;6&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;6&lt;/code&gt; certainly looks intimidating:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;32 ::    *[a 6 b c d]     *[a 2 [0 1] 2 [1 c d] [1 0] 2 [1 2 3] [1 0] 4 4 b]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could explain &lt;code&gt;6&lt;/code&gt; as a reduction sequence. But it’s a long one. Instead, let’s invent another operator which makes &lt;code&gt;6&lt;/code&gt; easy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;   ::    $[0 b c]         b
   ::    $[1 b c]         c&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we can restate &lt;code&gt;6&lt;/code&gt; quite compactly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;32r::    *[a 6 b c d]     *[a $[*[a b] c d]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;6&lt;/code&gt; stands revealed as the humble if-then-else. Nock &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This excuse for an explanation may not satisfy everyone. A good exercise is to check that &lt;code&gt;6&lt;/code&gt; as defined &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; has these properties - and can’t be simplified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;_7&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt; is an audacious mystery:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;35 ::    *[a 9 b c]       *[a 7 c 2 [0 1] 0 b]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll reduce &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt; but not explain it. When we use it in an example, it’ll be obvious what it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[a 7 c 2 [0 1] 0 b]]

  &amp;lt;&amp;lt;33r::    *[a 7 b c]       *[*[a b] c]&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

*[*[a c] 2 [0 1] 0 b]]

  &amp;lt;&amp;lt;27 ::    *[a 2 b c]       *[*[a b] *[a c]]&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

*[*[*[a c] [0 1]] *[*[a c] 0 b]]

  &amp;lt;&amp;lt;25 ::    *[a 0 b]         /[b a]&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

*[*[a c] *[*[a c] 0 b]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;35r::    *[a 9 b c]       *[*[a c] *[*[a c] 0 b]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a really fine instinctive sense of Nock, you might understand what &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt; is for. Otherwise, don’t worry for now.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;urbit-is-easy-ch1.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prev&lt;/strong&gt;: Setup&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;urbit-is-easy-ch3.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt;: Nock Is Easy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What one fool can do, another can”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(Ancient Simian proverb)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve installed Arvo, let’s learn Nock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of Nock as a kind of functional assembly language. It’s not like assembly language in that it’s directly executed by the hardware. It is like assembly language in that (a) everything in Urbit executes as Nock; (b) you wouldn’t want to program directly in Nock; and (c) learning to program directly in Nock is a great way to start understanding Urbit from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as Unix runs C programs by compiling them to assembler, Urbit runs Hoon programs by compiling them to Nock. You could try to learn Hoon without learning Nock. But just as C is a thin wrapper over the physical CPU, Hoon is a thin wrapper over the Nock virtual machine. It’s a tall stack made of thin layers, which is much easier to learn a layer at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And unlike most fundamental theories of computing, there’s really nothing smart or interesting about Nock. Of course, in a strictly formal sense, all of computing is math. But that doesn’t mean it needs to feel like math. Nock is a simple mechanical device and it’s meant to feel that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;specification&quot;&gt;Specification&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the Nock spec. It may look slightly intimidating, but at least it isn’t long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, you can’t just look at this and tell what it’s doing. But at least there are only 39 lines of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1  ::    A noun is an atom or a cell.
2  ::    An atom is a natural number.
3  ::    A cell is an ordered pair of nouns.
4  ::
5  ::    nock(a)          *a
6  ::    [a b c]          [a [b c]]
7  ::
8  ::    ?[a b]           0
9  ::    ?a               1
10 ::    +[a b]           +[a b]
11 ::    +a               1 + a
12 ::    =[a a]           0
13 ::    =[a b]           1
14 ::    =a               =a
15 ::
16 ::    /[1 a]           a
17 ::    /[2 a b]         a
18 ::    /[3 a b]         b
19 ::    /[(a + a) b]     /[2 /[a b]]
20 ::    /[(a + a + 1) b] /[3 /[a b]]
21 ::    /a               /a
22 ::
23 ::    *[a [b c] d]     [*[a b c] *[a d]]
24 ::
25 ::    *[a 0 b]         /[b a]
26 ::    *[a 1 b]         b
27 ::    *[a 2 b c]       *[*[a b] *[a c]]
28 ::    *[a 3 b]         ?*[a b]
29 ::    *[a 4 b]         +*[a b]
30 ::    *[a 5 b]         =*[a b]
31 ::
32 ::    *[a 6 b c d]     *[a 2 [0 1] 2 [1 c d] [1 0] 2 [1 2 3] [1 0] 4 4 b]
33 ::    *[a 7 b c]       *[a 2 b 1 c]
34 ::    *[a 8 b c]       *[a 7 [[7 [0 1] b] 0 1] c]
35 ::    *[a 9 b c]       *[a 7 c 2 [0 1] 0 b]
36 ::    *[a 10 [b c] d]  *[a 8 c 7 [0 3] d]
37 ::    *[a 10 b c]      *[a c]
38 ::
39 ::    *a               *a&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bear in mind: this is pseudocode. It is neither Nock nor Hoon. Strictly speaking, it’s really just English. All formal systems resolve to informal language at the very bottom. What’s important is just that no two reasonable people can read the spec to mean two different things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sounds&quot;&gt;Sounds&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In characteristic Urbit style, we got tired of three or four-syllable pronunciations of ASCII punctuation characters and assigned them all standard one-syllable names. We’ll meet the rest later, but the ones we use in Nock:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;`$`   buc
`/`   fas
`+`   lus
`(`   pel
`)`   per
`[`   sel
`]`   ser
`*`   tar
`=`   tis
`?`   wut&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nouns&quot;&gt;Nouns&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at the data model first - lines 1-3 above. Ideally, you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; look at this and just tell what it’s doing. But let’s explain it a little anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An atom is a natural number - ie, an unsigned integer. Nock does not limit the size of atoms, or know what an atom means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, the atom 97 might mean the number 97, or it might mean the letter ‘a’ (ASCII 97). A very large atom might be the number of grains of sand on the beach - or it might be a GIF of your children playing on the beach. Typically when we represent strings or files as atoms, the first byte is the low byte. But even this is just a convention. An atom is an atom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cell is an ordered pair of any two nouns - cell or atom. We group cells with square brackets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[1 1]
[34 45]
[[3 42] 12]
[[1 0] [0 [1 99]]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To keep our keyboards from wearing out, line 6 tells us that brackets group to the right:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;6  ::    [a b c]           [a [b c]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So instead of writing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[2 3]
[2 [6 7]]
[2 [6 [14 15]]]
[2 [6 [[28 29] [30 31]]]]
[2 [6 [[28 29] [30 [62 63]]]]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we can write&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[2 3]
[2 6 7]
[2 6 14 15]
[2 6 [28 29] 30 31]
[2 6 [28 29] 30 62 63]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this notational convenience is hardly rocket science, it’s surprising how confusing it can be, especially if you have a Lisp background. Lisp’s “S-expressions” are very similar to nouns, except that Lisp has multiple types of atom, and Lisp’s syntax automatically adds list terminators to groups. So in Lisp&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#39;(2 6 7)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is a shorthand for&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#39;(2 6 7 . nil)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and the equivalent noun is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[2 6 7 0]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or, of course,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[2 [6 [7 0]]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rules&quot;&gt;Rules&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Nock program is given meaning by a process of reduction. To compute &lt;code&gt;Nock(x)&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is any noun, we step through the rules from the top down, find the first left-hand side that matches &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, and reduce it to the right-hand side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right away we see line 5:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;5  ::    Nock(a)           *a&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we use variable names, like &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, in the pseudocode spec, we simply mean that the rule fits for any noun &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So &lt;code&gt;Nock(x)&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;*x&lt;/code&gt;, for any noun &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;. And how do we reduce &lt;code&gt;*x&lt;/code&gt;? Looking up, we see that lines 23 through 39 reduce &lt;code&gt;*x&lt;/code&gt; - for different patterns of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, suppose our &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;[5 1 6]&lt;/code&gt;. Stepping downward through the rules, the first one that matches is line 26:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;26 ::    *[a 1 b]        b&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Line 26 tells us that when reducing any noun of the form &lt;code&gt;[a 1
b]&lt;/code&gt;, the result is just &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;. So &lt;code&gt;*[5 1 6]&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;6&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a more complicated example, try&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*[[19 42] [0 3] 0 2]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first rule it matches is line 23:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;23 ::    *[a [b c] d]     [*[a b c] *[a d]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;since &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;[19 42]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;[0 2]&lt;/code&gt;. So this reduces to a new computation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[*[[19 42] 0 3] *[[19 42] 0 2]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each side of this matches rule 25:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;25 ::    *[a 0 b]         /[b a]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we have&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[/[3 [19 42]] /[2 [19 42]]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we explain &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;, we’ll see that this is &lt;code&gt;[42 19]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, suppose our &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is just &lt;code&gt;42&lt;/code&gt;. The first rule that matches is the last:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;39 ::    *a               *a&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So &lt;code&gt;*42&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;*42&lt;/code&gt;, which is &lt;code&gt;*42&lt;/code&gt;. Logically, Nock goes into an infinite reduction loop and never terminates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, this is just a clever CS way to specify the simple reality that &lt;code&gt;*42&lt;/code&gt; is an error and makes no sense. An actual interpreter will not spin forever - it will throw an exception outside the computation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;functions&quot;&gt;Functions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve already seen the &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; function (pronounced “tar”), which just means &lt;code&gt;Nock&lt;/code&gt;. This is the main show and we’ll work through it soon, but first let’s explain the functions it uses - &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;equals_&quot;&gt;Equals: &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; (pronounced “tis”, or sometimes “is”) tests a cell for equality. &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; means yes, &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; means no:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;12 ::    =[a a]           0
13 ::    =[a b]           1
14 ::    =a               =a&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, testing an atom for equality makes no sense and logically fails to terminate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;depth_&quot;&gt;Depth: &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; (pronounced “wut”) tests whether is a noun is a cell. Again, &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; means yes, &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; means no:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;8  ::    ?[a b]           0
9  ::    ?a               1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This convention is the opposite of old-fashioned booleans, so we try hard to say “yes” and “no” instead of “true” and “false.”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;increment_&quot;&gt;Increment: &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; (pronounced “lus”, or sometimes “plus”) adds 1 to an atom:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;10 ::    +[a b]           +[a b]
11 ::    +a               1 + a&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; works only for atoms, whereas &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; works only for cells, the error rule matches first for &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; and last for &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;address_&quot;&gt;Address: &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; (pronounced “fas”) is a tree address function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;16 ::    /[1 a]           a
17 ::    /[2 a b]         a
18 ::    /[3 a b]         b
19 ::    /[(a + a) b]     /[2 /[a b]]
20 ::    /[(a + a + 1) b] /[3 /[a b]]
21 ::    /a               /a&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This looks way more complicated than it is. Essentially, we define a noun as a binary tree - where each node branches to a left and right child - and assign an address, or &lt;em&gt;axis&lt;/em&gt;, to every element in the tree. The root of the tree is &lt;code&gt;/1&lt;/code&gt;. The left child of every node at &lt;code&gt;/a&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;/2a&lt;/code&gt;; the right child is &lt;code&gt;/2a+1&lt;/code&gt;. (Writing &lt;code&gt;(a
+ a)&lt;/code&gt; is just a clever way to write &lt;code&gt;2*a&lt;/code&gt;, while minimizing the set of pseudocode forms.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a complete tree of depth 3, the axis address space looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;         1
    2          3
 4    5     6     7
8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s use the example &lt;code&gt;[[97 2] [1 42 0]]&lt;/code&gt;. So&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/[1 [97 2] [1 42 0]]      [[97 2] [1 42 0]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;because &lt;code&gt;/1&lt;/code&gt; is the root of the tree, ie, the whole noun. Then its left child is &lt;code&gt;/2&lt;/code&gt; (ie, &lt;code&gt;(1 + 1)&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/[2 [97 2] [1 42 0]]      [97 2]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And its right child is &lt;code&gt;/3&lt;/code&gt; (ie, &lt;code&gt;(1 + 1 + 1)&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/[3 [97 2] [1 42 0]]      [1 42 0]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And delving into &lt;code&gt;/3&lt;/code&gt;, we see &lt;code&gt;/(3 + 3)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;(3 + 3 + 1)&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/[6 [97 2] [1 42 0]]      1
/[7 [97 2] [1 42 0]]      [42 0]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this seems like rocket science, the problem may be that you’re too smart to understand Nock. Forget everything you learned in school and start over from line 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also fun to build nouns in which every atom is its own axis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1
[2 3]
[2 6 7]
[[4 5] 6 7]
[[4 5] 6 14 15]
[[4 5] [12 13] 14 15]
[[4 [10 11]] [12 13] 14 15]
[[[8 9] [10 11]] [12 13] 14 30 31]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve spent enough time programming in Urbit, you’ll know these axes in your dreams. No - really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;urbit-is-easy-ch1.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prev&lt;/strong&gt;: Setup&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;urbit-is-easy-ch3.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt;: Nock Is Easy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;urbit-is-easy-ch2.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next&lt;/strong&gt;: Intro To Nock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tlön is surely a labyrinth, but it is a labyrinth devised by men, a labyrinth destined to be deciphered by men.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prepare_your_computer&quot;&gt;Prepare your computer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urbit runs on Unix machines only. It depends on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gmp&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;libsigsegv&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;openssl&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;libssl-dev (Linux only)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;ncurses (Linux only)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently we support OSX, Linux (not all distributions have been tested) and *BSD. There are no instructions for BSD, because only people with a serious clue run BSD. Intrepid ninjas may attempt ports to other OSes. If you’re not an intrepid ninja, try a VM (eg, VirtualBox).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, open up your terminal and let’s get started:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;configure_os_x&quot;&gt;Configure OS X&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have XCode? Type &lt;code&gt;gcc&lt;/code&gt;. If it says &lt;code&gt;no input files&lt;/code&gt;, you have XCode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, install XCode: &lt;code&gt;https://developer.apple.com/xcode/&lt;/code&gt;, with the command line tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install dependencies. Pick either one of Homebrew or Macports, but not both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homebrew? Type &lt;code&gt;brew&lt;/code&gt;. If it does something, you have Homebrew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, &lt;code&gt;ruby -e &amp;quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; will install it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And follow up with &lt;code&gt;brew install git gmp libsigsegv openssl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will ask you for the root password, which ideally you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macports? Type &lt;code&gt;port&lt;/code&gt;. If it does something, you have Macports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise go &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macports.org/install.php&quot; title=&quot;here&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then &lt;code&gt;sudo port install git gmp libsigsegv openssl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter your root password at the prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;configure_linux_ubuntu_or_debian&quot;&gt;Configure Linux (Ubuntu or Debian)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install libgmp3-dev libsigsegv-dev openssl libssl-dev libncurses5-dev git make exuberant-ctags&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;configure_linux_aws&quot;&gt;Configure Linux (AWS)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo yum --enablerepo epel install gcc git gmp-devel openssl-devel ncurses-devel libsigsegv-devel ctags&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;get_the_source&quot;&gt;Get the source&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urbit uses git for its revision control. Eventually, Urbit will use itself for this, but for now, you need git. If you’ve followed the above instructions correctly then typing &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; in your terminal should do something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that works, run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;`git clone https://github.com/urbit/urbit.git`.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to download Urbit from its repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If for some reason you have moral qualms about using Git, you can also just download and unzip &lt;code&gt;https://github.com/urbit/urbit/archive/master.zip&lt;/code&gt;. This won’t provide any version control&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;set_up_your_enviroment&quot;&gt;Set up your enviroment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; to the unpacked Urbit directory you just created:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd urbit&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this works, &lt;code&gt;ls urb&lt;/code&gt; should show:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;urbit.pill  zod/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great! Now, let’s do some dirty Unix stuff to set up your environment. If you know what this is doing, feel free to do it right. Otherwise:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo &amp;quot;export URBIT_HOME=`pwd`/urb&amp;quot; &amp;gt;&amp;gt;~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make sure this worked,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo $URBIT_HOME&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;should show &lt;code&gt;/urb&lt;/code&gt; within the current directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this didn’t work, you’ll have to do this the hard way. run &lt;code&gt;vi ~/.bash_profile&lt;/code&gt; and fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;build&quot;&gt;Build&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;. Sometimes things are just easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;run&quot;&gt;Run&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;bin/vere -c mypier&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;mypier&lt;/code&gt; is a directory that doesn’t yet exist. All your state (an append-only log and a memory checkpoint) will live in this directory. Its name doesn’t matter and is not visible internally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;pier&lt;/em&gt; is an Urbit virtual machine that hosts one or more Urbit identities, or &lt;em&gt;ships&lt;/em&gt;. When you run &lt;code&gt;vere -c&lt;/code&gt;, it automatically creates a 128-bit ship, or &lt;code&gt;submarine&lt;/code&gt;. Your name (a hash of a randomly-generated public key) will look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~machec-binnev-dordeb-sogduc--dosmul-sarrum-faplec-nidted&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First you’ll see a string of messages like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;vere: urbit home is /Users/cyarvin/Documents/src/u3/urb
loom: mapped 1024MB
time: ~2013.9.1..03.57.11..4935
ames: on localhost, UDP 63908.
generating 2048-bit RSA pair...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then it’ll pause a little, ‘cause this is slow, and then&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;saving passcode in /Users/cyarvin/.urbit/~magsut-hopful.txt
(for real security, write it down and delete the file...)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and, then, if the network gods are happy, your submarine will start pulling down Arvo files:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; + /~machec-binnev-dordeb-sogduc--dosmul-sarrum-faplec-nidted/main/1/bin/ticket/hoon
 + /~machec-binnev-dordeb-sogduc--dosmul-sarrum-faplec-nidted/main/1/bin/reset/hoon
 + /~machec-binnev-dordeb-sogduc--dosmul-sarrum-faplec-nidted/main/1/bin/ye/hoon
 + /~machec-binnev-dordeb-sogduc--dosmul-sarrum-faplec-nidted/main/1/bin/ls/hoon&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and the like. You’ll see a couple pages of this stuff. Don’t worry too much about the details right now. Finally, you’ll get the Arvo shell prompt (which is also a Hoon REPL):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~machec-binnev-dordeb-sogduc--dosmul-sarrum-faplec-nidted/try=&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;register&quot;&gt;Register&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, you need to decide whether a mere submarine is enough for you right now. This monicker is a mouthful. You can stick with it (for now), but you’re going to need a wider xterm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which might be fine! However, please note that just by sending a simple email, you can get a much better ship - a &lt;code&gt;destroyer&lt;/code&gt;, with a nice short name like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just email &lt;code&gt;urbit@urbit.org&lt;/code&gt;, with your submarine in the subject. We’ll send you destroyers - not one, but &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt;. Yes, two! Tell us something cool in the body, and we’ll send you even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a destroyer, you need to configure it. Otherwise, just stretch that xterm wide and skip to section 1.2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your destroyers will arrive in the form of &lt;code&gt;[ship ticket]&lt;/code&gt; pairs. Let’s say one of your ships is &lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc&lt;/code&gt; and its ticket is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~ribdyr-famtem-larrun-figtyd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(What are these strings, anyway? Just random unsigned integers, rendered in Hoon’s syllabic base, &lt;code&gt;@p&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new life awaits you on the off-world colonies! To begin, just type at the prompt:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;:begin ~waclux-tomwyc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and follow the directions. When the script completes, hit return and you’ll be the &lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc&lt;/code&gt; you wanted to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;play_with_arvo&quot;&gt;Play with Arvo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all went well, you now have a nice short prompt:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all did not go well (send us another email), or you’re just too impatient to wait for your destroyer, you have a big long prompt. Which is fine, really, just ugly - and all these exercises will still work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;example_commands&quot;&gt;Example commands&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s try a few quick things to stretch your fingers. Type these command lines and you should see the matching results:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; &amp;quot;hello, world&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;hello, world&amp;quot;

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; (add 2 2)
4

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :hello %world
&amp;quot;hello, world.&amp;quot;

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :cat /=main=/bin/hello/hoon
::
::  /=main=/bin/hello/hoon
::
|=  *
|=  [planet=@ta ~]
^-  bowl
:_  ~  :_  ~
:-  %%
!&amp;gt;(&amp;quot;hello, {(trip planet)}.&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did you just do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One, you used Arvo as a Hoon REPL to print the constant &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;hello,
world&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;, which is a fancy way to write the Nock noun&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[104 101 108 108 111 44 32 119 111 114 108 100 0]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two, you called the Hoon &lt;code&gt;add&lt;/code&gt; function to see that two plus two is four. Math seems to work the same on the off-world colonies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three, you ran the Arvo application &lt;code&gt;:hello&lt;/code&gt; with the argument &lt;code&gt;%world&lt;/code&gt;, which is just a fancy way to write the atom &lt;code&gt;431.316.168.567&lt;/code&gt; (or, for non-Germans, &lt;code&gt;431,316,168,567&lt;/code&gt;). You might recognize it better as &lt;code&gt;0x64.6c72.6f77&lt;/code&gt; - the ASCII characters in LSB first order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Is Urbit German? Sadly, no. But all our noun print formats are URL-safe, which dot is and comma isn’t.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you (4) used the Arvo application :cat to print the Hoon file&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/=main=/bin/hello/hoon&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which, supposing your current date is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~2013.9.1..04.38.31..f259&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(ie, September 1, 2013 at 4:38:31 GMT/LS25 plus 0xf259/65536 seconds), is equivalent to the global path&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/~waclux-tomwyc/main/~2013.8.23..04.38.31..f259/bin/hello/hoon&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which anyone in Urbit can, see and even use - but we’re getting ahead of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;control_characters&quot;&gt;Control characters&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, what we’ve seen is that Arvo is a dangerous and powerful operating system which if handled improperly can cause serious injury or loss of life. We exaggerate. Slightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you need to know is how to control this tool. Try your arrow keys - you’ll see that Arvo has traditional Unix history editing. Up and down, left and right work, as do the simple emacs controls:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;^A  go to beginning of line
^B  left arrow
^D  delete next character
^E  go to end of line
^F  right arrow
^K  kill to end of line
^L  clear the screen
^R  search through history
^U  kill the whole line
^Y  yank (restore from kill ring)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t expect any other emacs (or even readline - this is not readline, it’s internal to Arvo) commands to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also some special control keys specific to Arvo. It’s a good idea to learn these first so that you feel in, um, control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we’ll quit out of an infinite loop with &lt;code&gt;^C&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :infinite&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you hit return at the end of this line, Arvo will appear to hang. Do not be alarmed! This is not a bug - it means that we’ve started running our infinite loop before printing the next console prompt. Simply hit &lt;code&gt;^C&lt;/code&gt;, and you’ll see&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;! intr
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :infinite&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(There may be some stacktrace stuff before the &lt;code&gt;! intr&lt;/code&gt;, depending on whether your kernel was compiled with debugging.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hit &lt;code&gt;^U&lt;/code&gt; to delete the line and escape from infinity. Arvo is a deterministic OS; you interrupted it while processing an event that would never terminate. It returns to the state it was in before you hit return - as if nothing had ever happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re probably used to using nondeterministic, preemptive OSes, in which the difference between a waiting task and an executing event isn’t apparent to the user. Since Arvo is not preemptive, it has two very different states: waiting and working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Arvo is working, &lt;code&gt;^C&lt;/code&gt; cancels the event it’s working on. This event never happened. Don’t worry, nothing bad will happen to your computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Arvo is waiting, use &lt;code&gt;^D&lt;/code&gt; to end the current task, which is the task that’s currently prompting you. If there is a live prompt and the cursor is not at the end, &lt;code&gt;^D&lt;/code&gt; will delete the current character - as in Unix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try this by running&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :begin

Do you have a ship and a ticket? yes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then hit &lt;code&gt;^D&lt;/code&gt; and you’ll be back to the command prompt (which, unlike in Unix, is not a task itself, but part of the OS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t always want to kill the prompting task. We often want to switch between tasks, or between tasks and the command line. Sort of like switching between windows, except in a command line. We do this with &lt;code&gt;^X&lt;/code&gt;. Try&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :begin

Do you have a ship and a ticket? yes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But hit &lt;code&gt;^X&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;^D&lt;/code&gt;. You’ll get a prompt again. Use it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :begin

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :hello %world
&amp;quot;hello, world.&amp;quot;
~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hit &lt;code&gt;^X&lt;/code&gt; again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :begin

~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :hello %world
&amp;quot;hello, world.&amp;quot;
Do you have a ship and a ticket? yes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, hit &lt;code&gt;^C&lt;/code&gt; to kill the task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s one more magic control key that switches your whole reality. This is &lt;code&gt;^W&lt;/code&gt;, which switches between the ships in a pier. Do you have multiple ships in your pier? Sure - you still have your old submarine. Hit &lt;code&gt;^W&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~machec-binnev-dordeb-sogduc--dosmul-sarrum-faplec-nidted/try=&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hit &lt;code&gt;^W&lt;/code&gt; again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Arvo is a single-level store. Since it’s not the ’70s anymore and disk is cheap, everything you do is saved for ever. (In fact, it’s saved in two ways - as a memory image and an event log - so you, or the government if they haz your filez, can repeat every computation you’ve every performed.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the current prompt is just the shell prompt, &lt;code&gt;^D&lt;/code&gt; on an empty line will log out - as in Unix:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt;
oxford:~/urbit; pwd
/Users/cyarvin/urbit
oxford:~/urbit; echo &amp;quot;hello, world&amp;quot;
hello, world
oxford:~/urbit;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you can restart and be right back where you were - just run &lt;code&gt;vere&lt;/code&gt; without &lt;code&gt;-c&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;oxford:~/urbit; bin/vere mypier
vere: urbit home is /Users/cyarvin/urb
loom: loaded 9MB
time: ~2013.9.1..17.23.05..0cc1
ames: on localhost, UDP 60342.
http: live on 8080
rest: checkpoint to event 383
rest: old 0v1c.gkr1o, new 0v10.m4gdu
---------------- playback complete----------------
waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use your arrow keys and you’ll see your history is still there. Arvo is indestructible and can be shut down however you like without losing data. Also, starting a new task while an old one is still running will kill the old one safely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don’t try to operate the same ship on two Unix hosts at the same time. This will confuse everyone, including yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;system_administration&quot;&gt;System administration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we make changes to Hoon or Arvo (we never make changes to Nock) and you need to update your ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two steps to updating. You need to get the new files, and you need to install them. To get them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :update
: /~waclux-tomwyc/arvo/2/hoon/hoon
: /~waclux-tomwyc/arvo/2/dill/hoon
: /~waclux-tomwyc/arvo/2/batz/hoon&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To install them (the simplest, slowest, most general way):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :reset

%reset-start
%reset-parsed
%reset-compiled
%hoon-load
[%tang /~waclux-tomwyc/arvo/~2013.11.26..20.29.15..090f/zuse ~tirnux-latwex]
[%vane %a /~waclux-tomwyc/arvo/~2013.11.26..20.29.15..090f/ames ~tolryn-watret]
[%vane %b /~waclux-tomwyc/arvo/~2013.11.26..20.29.15..090f/batz ~donfex-ladsem]
[%vane %c /~waclux-tomwyc/arvo/~2013.11.26..20.29.15..090f/clay ~picsug-mitref]
[%vane %d /~waclux-tomwyc/arvo/~2013.11.26..20.29.15..090f/dill ~dilpex-laptug]
[%vane %e /~waclux-tomwyc/arvo/~2013.11.26..20.29.15..090f/eyre ~forbur-disben]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of your state, including running tasks, will be unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the interpreter, called &lt;code&gt;vere&lt;/code&gt; gets updated. In your urbit directory, back in Unixland, run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git pull origin master&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;every so often to get the latest Urbit source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chat&quot;&gt;Chat&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, fine. You’re a long way from being an Arvo ninja. But - you’re ready for the two most important uses of Urbit right now. One, coding. Two, chatting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start coding, read the next chapter. To start chatting, simply type&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~waclux-tomwyc/try=&amp;gt; :chat
&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and type &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; for help.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Hi Zod! or basic Urbit tunneling</title>
   <link href="http://urbit.org/2013/10/08/hizod.html"/>
   <updated>2013-10-08T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://urbit.org/2013/10/08/hizod</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One bug, or really minor misfeature, in Urbit’s networking - not the evil :update bug, possibly aka “ok/not responding,” which remains my main quarry today, but one I had to investigate on the way to it - is that it’s all very well and good to punch a NAT hole, but a lot of routers - for I guess understandable reasons - like to heal the hole up relatively quickly. As in, a minute or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally this means you’re (a) totally disconnected from the Internets and Urbit too, (b) when you return, it will be with a different 48-bit address, and (c) returning means you need to re-establish your hierarchical route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two ways a ship talks to another ship. Actually, there are three. In A, my ship knows your ship’s 48-bit UDP address (ie, IPv4+port). (Like everywhere on the internets, IPv6 is perfectly supported in theory.) In B, my ship &lt;em&gt;thinks it might&lt;/em&gt; know your ship’s address. In C, it knows it doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In C, it forwards through the hierarchy, which for now at present every destroyer is ~doznec through ~zod. In A, it sends a direct packet. In B - the state I enter when I’ve received a &lt;em&gt;forwarded&lt;/em&gt; packet from you, not knowing whether I can send back through the hole - because it is not a tunnel from you to me, but from you to the first ship, probably ~doznec, on the hierarchical path from you to me - it sends &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as one party in the conversation can have its tunnels forwarded (“full cone NAT”), we can converge on a direct conversation with both ships in state C (“STUN”). Otherwise, we end up with the dramatically inferior perma-forwarded TURN. Earlier in the summer it was the major cause of Urbit flakage, but NAT traversal seems to work okay now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With one exception. If I forward to ~doznec, how does the packet then get to you? ~doznec needs a valid 48-bit UDP address for you, which was the address you used to talk to it. (The #1 newbie Unix network programming question: what system call do I use to get my own IP address()? There are a lot of ways to do it, all bad. The answer is that you shouldn’t depend on your own IP address - and to the world, your address is where they see your packets coming from.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of us are old and some of us who are old worked with old people when we were young. I remember in the early ’90s, when I was working on interactive TV, this incredibly ancient person was in the office for some reason - probably looking for the Medicare clinic - and he explained that he’d worked on Telex. Not everyone in the room knew what Telex was, so he explained it. “Telex,” he said, “was the information superhighway when it was paved with gravel.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, there’s certainly &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; asphalt on the Internets, but… in a network paved with gravel, there is no way to keep your hole up but continuous active pinging. As a result, on a bad network your connectivity can only be restored by a trivial communication up the hierarchy - ie, :hi ~zod. The reason this isn’t done automatically is just that functionality of this type is currently in the process of migrating out of the kernel into userspace. So, while Urbit remains in the NICU… doing it manually never ever hurts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I welcome peoples’ opinions on the right &lt;em&gt;period&lt;/em&gt; for this keepalive. Is 2 min short enough? Ya think? I am anything but an expert here&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Urbit, from the NICU to ops Week</title>
   <link href="http://urbit.org/2013/10/06/nicu.html"/>
   <updated>2013-10-06T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://urbit.org/2013/10/06/nicu</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;(TLDR: to keep using Urbit, delete all your pre-10/6 data, git pull the source again, make clean, make, and start over. Your destroyers and tickets will keep working. No, this will not keep happening, though it may happen once or twice again.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urbit has been in the wild for almost two weeks now. Which is crazy. Also, 11.000 people have (according to Vimeo) watched our 10-minute screencast of a command-line session. Apparently in a world of suck, there is a lot of pent-up demand for !suck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What sucks is that we can’t really satisfy this demand right now. Because Urbit still sucks. It was born prematurely and is doing all it can to keep breathing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least we’ve finished the major revision control update that was in the works. Now if your friend &lt;code&gt;~tomsyt-balsen&lt;/code&gt; else has a desk (ie, branch) &lt;code&gt;funky&lt;/code&gt; you want to use, you can&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tasfyn-partyv/try=&amp;gt; :clone /~tomsyt-balsen/funky&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and &lt;code&gt;funky&lt;/code&gt; will be on &lt;code&gt;~tasfyn-partyv&lt;/code&gt; promptly. To update, just use the same command again. It can even merge a bit. Also,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tasfyn-partyv/try=&amp;gt; :update&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;will update the core files you got when your ship was born. And finally, if the Arvo sources change, you can reload everything very simply with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tasfyn-partyv/try=&amp;gt; :reset&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will replace all the Arvo code, including Hoon in Hoon itself, and keep your data intact - even running processes. We told you there was a use for Nock. For a simpler change in a single vane (kernel module), eg &lt;code&gt;%clay&lt;/code&gt; (revision control), just&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~tasfyn-partyv/try=&amp;gt; :reload %clay&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bear in mind that for updates in the standard library (&lt;code&gt;%zuse&lt;/code&gt;) to propagate to the shell (&lt;code&gt;%batz&lt;/code&gt;), you need to reload first &lt;code&gt;%zuse&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;%batz&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But - isn’t all this rather premature? Yes, it is! The point of this update was not that anyone needs real revision control in Urbit yet, except of course for Urbit itself. The point is that we need to stabilize our data structures, because Urbit needs to get to continuity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is continuity, exactly? It’s a problem that emerges in a network of single-level stores. No one has built such a network before, to my knowledge, so we’re making it up as we go along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a normal 20th-century OS, there is a hierarchy of ephemeral and persistent data that corresponds to the memory hierarchy on a normal computer. People sometimes talk about DRAM replacements that are naturally persistent, but even if DRAM was persistent, a computer running Unix would still need to be rebooted. In Unix, a TCP socket is ephemeral relative to a process, and a process is ephemeral relative to the filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Arvo there is no ephemeral state anywhere. All state is consistent and indefinitely preserved. This works great when it works perfectly, but it also removes a source of resilience. Essentially the Urbit approach is to operate with high precision and low tolerance, like an American aerospace design. The Unix approach has a more… Soviet… quality. Truly excellent in its own way - don’t get me wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, for example, every network connection needs to maintain message sequence numbers on both sides. On Unix, these are bound to your TCP socket, which is doubly ephemeral. In Urbit, they are bound to your public key (certificate iteration). If your ship loses continuity, it needs to generate a new key. This should not happen often - in a healthy ecosystem, never. We know how to compute reliably in the cloud - when was the last time, say, a Google app lost your data?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, unlike in Unix, all our data is structured and typed. When we change the type of state, whether at the kernel or user level, we have to write a type adaptor. We can. So the only excuse for ephemerality is that the underlying computer can fail, which is what redundancy is for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, with an immature system, it’s often a lot easier just to throw away your whole state and reboot the universe. So… we’ve been doing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which we hope to change this week. If you’re using Urbit this week, it’s Ops Week. We’ll be trying to keep the server up and usable for the most trivial task of a social network, chat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, since Urbit is still in the NICU, join us on IRC at #urbit on freenode. Starting Monday morning, it’ll be a big nonstop party with occasional disasters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally… anyone operating the submarines prefixed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;~fotdug-milred
~ritheb-latlen
~hidnyr-rivrun
~binnep-lagser&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you’re sending us packets in the old protocol. Please follow these instructions at the top, so we can delete you from our crude manual packet blacklist! Because when we break the world, we really break it&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Not less because in purple I descended&lt;br /&gt;The western day through what you called&lt;br /&gt;The loneliest air, not less was I myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was the ointment sprinkled on my beard?&lt;br /&gt;What were the hymns that buzzed beside my ears?&lt;br /&gt;What was the sea whose tide swept through me there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of my mind the golden ointment rained,&lt;br /&gt;And my ears made the blowing hymns they heard.&lt;br /&gt;I was myself the compass of that sea:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was the world in which I walked, and what I saw&lt;br /&gt;Or heard or felt came not but from myself;&lt;br /&gt;And there I found myself more truly and more strange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Wallace Stevens&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hymn can be full of love, or hate. And the quality of Urbit&amp;#8217;s haters is absurdly high. We cherish each and every one of them. There&amp;#8217;s something sublime about being hit with a perfectly-formed jab. So we&amp;#8217;d like to serve some of the choicest examples for you here, names redacted (we don&amp;#8217;t want to embarrass anyone). Here they are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20130925195007/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2013/09/24/203134/exclusive-john-mcafee-vows-to.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#39;It&#39;s an image. It&#39;s a link&#39; src=&#39;/assets/tweets.png&#39; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Sadly, though we&amp;#8217;re avid followers of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_24168403/exclusive-john-mcafee-vows-make-internet-impossible-hack&quot;&gt;adventures&lt;/a&gt; of John McAfee, he&amp;#8217;s not involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href=&#39;http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3571697&amp;amp;userid=0&amp;amp;perpage=40&amp;amp;pagenumber=2#post419831292&#39;&gt;outside&lt;/a&gt; the Twitterverse is where&lt;a href=&#39;http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3571697&amp;amp;userid=0&amp;amp;perpage=40&amp;amp;pagenumber=2#post419831292&#39;&gt; things &lt;/a&gt; really start to&lt;a href=&#39;http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3571697&amp;amp;userid=0&amp;amp;perpage=40&amp;amp;pagenumber=1#post419822422&#39;&gt; shine.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; is how you gripe:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this one looks like x86 assembly had a fetal alcohol syndrome love child with haskell&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so are there actually several people involved in this, and if so, what language do they speak amongst themselves?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or do they just gently sway in unison, softly keening&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;++  grip			 ::  extend will  
  |=  [wet=will law=will]  
  ^-  will  
  ?~  wet  law  
  ?:  =(wet law)  law  
  ?^  t.wet  
    ?&amp;gt;((meld i.wet i.t.wet) [i.wet $(wet t.wet)])  
  ?~  law  
    ?&amp;gt;((pier i.wet) [i.wet ~])  
  ?~  q.p.q.i.wet  
    ?&amp;gt;((meld i.wet i.law) [i.wet law])  S&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it&amp;#8217;s like the obfuscated c code contestants and the losethos guy got together and created a monster&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;wait why do I feel moist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And our &lt;a href=&#39;http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2013-09-25&#39;&gt;favorite:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Continuity timeframe</title>
   <link href="http://urbit.org/2013/09/25/continuity.html"/>
   <updated>2013-09-25T15:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://urbit.org/2013/09/25/continuity</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thought we’d share the following email that we sent out on the developers mailing list (urbit-dev@googlegroups.org):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Urbit! You’ve been added to this mailing list because you all are now proud owners of one or more destroyers (let us know if you’re not and we’ll remedy that). We’ll be using this list to update all of you with the latest news from the offworld colonies. Presently your subscription settings are at one digest email daily (we have a powerful hatred of listserv-spam). Feel free to change these settings on Google Groups to whatever you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our target date for network continuity is Friday October 4th. At which point the data structures we create will (if we succeed) live forever. We’ll almost certainly do at least one reboot sometime before then, so you’ll have to recreate your destroyers from your keys when we do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, we plan on putting up some actual Hoon doc by then, so you all can, you know, actually learn Hoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll leave you with some Borges: “Stranger and more pure than any hron is, at times, the ur: the object produced through suggestion, educed by hope.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this blog post is not limited to 1000 words (seriously Google) and because I love that quote so damn much, I’ll post the whole thing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the most ancient regions of Tlön, the duplication of lost objects is not infrequent. Two persons look for a pencil; the first finds it and says nothing; the second finds a second pencil, no less real, but closer to his expectations. These secondary objects are called hronir and are, though awkward in form, somewhat longer. Until recently, the hronir were the accidental products of distraction and forgetfulness. It seems unbelievable that their methodical production dates back scarcely a hundred years, but this is what the Eleventh Volume tells us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The methodical fabrication of hronir (says the Eleventh Volume) has performed prodigious services for archaeologists. It has made possible the interrogation and even the modification of the past, which is now no less plastic and docile than the future. Curiously, the hronir of second and third degree - the hronir derived from another hron, those derived from the hron of a hron - exaggerate the aberrations of the initial one; those of fifth degree are almost uniform; those of ninth degree become confused with those of the second; in those of the eleventh there is a purity of line not found in the original. The process is cyclical: the hron of the twelfth degree begins to fall off in quality. Stranger and more pure than any hron is, at times, the ur: the object produced through suggestion, educed by hope.”&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Welcome to Urbit</title>
   <link href="http://urbit.org/2013/09/24/urbit-intro.html"/>
   <updated>2013-09-24T15:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://urbit.org/2013/09/24/urbit-intro</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;But wait - what the hell is Urbit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of Urbit’s problems is that we don’t exactly have a word for what Urbit is. If there is such a word, it somehow means both “operating system” and “network protocol,” while somehow also implying “functional” and “deterministic.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only is there no such word, it’s not even clear there &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be one. And if there was, could we even hear it? As Wittgenstein said: if a lion could talk, we would not understand him. But heck, let’s try anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a network protocol, we could call Urbit a “seven-layer protocol” - that is, a protocol that specifies the complete semantics of the general-purpose computer that processes it. As any decent IETF ninja will tell you, this is a very bad idea for all sorts of extremely obvious reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And from the OS perspective, Urbit is yet another slice of userspace crap with the temerity to call itself an “operating system.” Urbit is not actually an OS in the bare-metal sense. It’s a VM that runs on Linux or OS X. Someday it might be so daring as to descend to Xen. Urbit has no interest at all in drivers, peripherals, etc. It is just a UDP transceiver in the cloud. Worst of all - Urbit is not even preemptive. A poser! (Actually all the real work, as in node, is done by libuv.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, this VM is formally isolated from your actual OS. And everything that uses it. Nothing in Urbit can request system services or call existing libraries. So Urbit is not only badly designed and fraudulently hyped. It’s also profoundly useless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well… your browser has been reasonably successful with this restriction. But your browser was never designed to be any kind of OS. To the extent that it’s sort of become an OS, it is specialized for the very undemanding job of being a client. A general-purpose client, which is neat. But not a general-purpose server - which is a much harder problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A general-purpose server is a slab of code that feels totally confident when faced with the problem of storing &lt;em&gt;all your personal and/or corporate data&lt;/em&gt;, across &lt;em&gt;arbitrary functional upgrades&lt;/em&gt;, for &lt;em&gt;all time forever&lt;/em&gt;, while efficiently executing and managing &lt;em&gt;any useful program or programs, transient or persistent&lt;/em&gt;. Yeah, that’s a server OS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, conventionally, this industrial strength slab of code is written with conventional OS techniques involving (a) bare metal and (b) like, semaphores and shit. The kernel alone is like 12 million lines of code. Not that a browser is any much smaller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, 20th-century network computing is the world’s most beautiful wire, between two dumpsters of shit spaghetti. Two &lt;em&gt;completely different&lt;/em&gt; dumpsters. It turns out that with a big enough dumpster of shit spaghetti, you can feed the world. And why not two? Incompatibility creates jobs, you know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and you can have a client without an identity. But you can’t have a &lt;em&gt;server&lt;/em&gt; without an identity. So Urbit has to solve &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; problem. Unless it’s just going to be a Web server. (Urbit is actually a perfectly decent Web server.) Unless it has an actual identity model, your general-purpose server - presumably a &lt;em&gt;network&lt;/em&gt; server - has no network effect. No identity, no network. No network, who the hell cares?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And unlike your ordinary, common or garden Web application server, Urbit does need that network effect. You see, it’s not even our own work. It’s something we found. On an unmarked USB stick by the side of the road three kilometers from Area 51.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think it’s probably still human engineering. First of all, there are no aliens. Second, Urbit uses Unicode. Do the aliens have Unicode? Or SHA-256? &lt;em&gt;Where did Unicode come from, anyway?&lt;/em&gt; And at the I/O level, we see UDP, HTTP, etc. The command line does Emacs keys. At the very least, someone on Earth (or at least &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; Earth) has done some porting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But other than these cosmetic details, there’s not much sign of a connection to ordinary Earth computing. For instance, Urbit isn’t written in any of our Earth languages. It is written in something called Hoon, which is a strict, higher-order, typed functional language - but has nothing in else in common with other Earth languages, functional or not. Hoon does not even use standard PL theory. And its syntax is just as alien, although at least it confines itself to the ASCII plane. (And you probably thought the “A” in “ASCII” stood for “American.”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worse yet, Hoon is not written in anything normal. It’s written in Hoon. To be precise - the Hoon compiler compiles itself to a much simpler automaton, Nock. Besides machine language itself, and its various bytecode homages, there are three simple formal models of computing - Turing machines, lambda calculus, and Chuck Moore. There is also a fourth which no one has ever found useful for anything: combinators. Nock is a combinator automaton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While nowhere near the simplest such automaton known, and certainly not of any &lt;em&gt;theoretical&lt;/em&gt; interest, Nock is so stupid that if you gzip the spec, it’s only 374 bytes. Nock’s only arithmetic operation is increment. So decrement is an &lt;code&gt;O(n)&lt;/code&gt;, operation; add is &lt;code&gt;O(m*n)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly not a practical system. Even if this… &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt;… that sits on top of it was in any way, shape or form remotely sane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why not try it? Heck, why not at least check it out? Strange and foolish dreamers may hie themselves to teh github:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/urbit&quot;&gt;https://github.com/urbit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various people have built and run Urbit on Ubuntu, Homebrew and MacPorts. It’s possible that all these people were stone cold ninjas. Urbit is a pretty cool toy, I think, if you’re a ninja. Unfortunately it is not really ready for ordinary rice farmers. If you can’t resolve build dependencies by hand, we’re sorry. Urbit is probably not yet ready for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where should you run Urbit? Ideally, in the cloud. Urbit can punch a decent NAT hole. It doesn’t like to, though - what does? Bear in mind that your Urbit instance is a single-level store - your state is saved as a log and a checkpoint (as in Redis - except that Redis is both fast and reliable). This will work much better on server hardware. That said, there are plenty of good reasons to keep your servers in the closet with the plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, you need a ticket. Or not. You at least need to decide whether you want a ticket or not. Actually, the answer is simple. You do want one. But you don’t need one - not yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because Urbit, the OS, never depends on Earth semantics, it needs its own network protocol - Ames. Ames is a P2P protocol with its own public-key infrastructure. (Ames is encrypted, but the current cryptosuite, suite A, is worthless snakeoil. Don’t trust it with your Trader Joe receipts.) Ames runs over UDP, and pays as little attention to IP routing as possible. Needless to say, Urbit does not use the DNS at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sling packets on Ames, you need an identity. Needless to say, there are a lot of ways to do distributed cryptographic identity, all of them bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general reason all PKIs suck is called “Zooko’s Triangle.” Your identities can be distributed, secure, or human-meaningful - pick any two. There is no way to solve Zooko’s Triangle. The only way to attack it is to compromise on at least one vertex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see how Urbit works, let’s start with a standard solution. An Urbit identity is called a “ship.” You can launch your own ship by generating a 2048-bit RSA key and hashing it to a 128-bit fingerprint, which is your identity. This trivial design is the basis of all distributed, secure PKIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, an identity should be above all a &lt;em&gt;name&lt;/em&gt;. A 128-bit fingerprint looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    316.931.986.049.624.498.975.974.005.376.666.572.699&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which isn’t a name. For no better reason than the fact that, unless you’re an autistic savant, you are basically a monkey with an overgrown monkey brain. A name is something that fits in a register. Your monkey brain doesn’t have 128-bit registers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose we could use 64-bit fingerprints? At first this seems even less promising. First of all, your monkey brain doesn’t have 64-bit registers, either. Second, at 64 bits, collisions are already a real problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we can solve both these problems. Your monkey brain doesn’t have 64-bit registers. But anything that lets us do 64-bit identities might stretch down to 32 bits. And at 64 or 32 bits, we can’t assign identities by random hash. So we’ll have to find another way of distributing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 32-bit identity - or even a 16-bit identity - will still never be human-meaningful. Perhaps we can make it human-memorable. Meaningful addresses are a nice feature in a social network, but memorable addresses are essential. And if we have memorable addresses, perhaps we can build meaningful names on top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The classic example of a memorable address is a street address. Your street address identifies you precisely, using a name. You have this great brain hardware for remembering names. But what does the name of your street &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt;? Nothing at all, usually. And even if it does mean something, by accident or design, that meaning has nothing at all to do with you. (One of us grew up in Columbia, Maryland, which has street names like “Greek Boy Place.”)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So all we need is a simple, tasteful, memorable way to remember 32 bits - and we’re on our way to approximating the Triangle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decimal notation is the worst way of remembering a 32-bit number. IP notation is a little better. Urbit has a typically crude approach: we map every byte to a CVC phoneme, making names like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;   ~tasfyn-partyv
   ~sivbud-barnel
   ~tomsyt-balsen&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These strings, while quite meaningless, are no less memorable than real human names in many a language. Moreover, they form a language of their own, and become more memorable as you use them. And there are 4 billion of them, which (as we’ll see) is almost exactly the right number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how do we distribute them? One obvious solution is a proof of work scheme, as in Bitcoin. Coordinating a global proof-of-work scheme is quite nontrivial, however. Also, there is a second reason to compromise 100% decentralization: packet routing. It might be possible to use a blockchain as a global routing table. It would take some thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, there’s a clue here that the Bitcoin approach just isn’t getting. The limited subspace of short names, within the general space of 128-bit names, is essentially &lt;em&gt;real estate&lt;/em&gt;. There is absolutely no reason, moral or practical, to give this real estate away for free to people whose only contribution is generating CO2 on their GPUs. Mining is not in any way a productive activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather, initially, this real estate belongs to Urbit itself. If Urbit has value, its real estate has value. If Urbit has no value, its so-called real estate is a bunch of worthless bits. Therefore, any value in the real estate can, should, and will be used to bootstrap the system from an economic perspective. Ie, it belongs to and will be captured by Urbit’s developers and/or early adopters. If you find this morally wrong, sorry. You’re probably some kind of a communist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But because Urbit is a free republican society - not (ahem) a fascist corporate dictatorship like Google, Facebook or Twitter - a crucial aspect of launching or transferring a ship is that the decision is irreversible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the master of an Urbit ship, your informal title is cryptographic and &lt;em&gt;allodial&lt;/em&gt; - no one, not the government and certainly not us, can challenge it. Unless the attacker can steal your secrets. In which case, of course, she might as well be you. That’s like Bitcoin too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Bitcoin is money, Urbit is land. (Floating land is still land, if there’s a limited amount of it.) You own both in the same way, by proving you can keep a secret. A Bitcoin is not useful for anything, except selling to a greater fool. (We’re just kidding - we’re huge Bitcoin fans.) But an Urbit ship is directly useful, so long as Urbit itself is useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You fill your Bitcoin wallet either by creating new coins, or buying old ones from Satoshi and his cronies. You build your Urbit fleet by buying ships from us and our cronies. (Don’t ask what we had to do to get them from the aliens. Those aliens are into a lot of strange shit, man.) Ships are transferable, but Urbit is not designed to be a digital currency. Transaction overhead is artificially high. Again, as in real estate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Urbit at present is empty and worthless. So 32-bit ships - destroyers - are $0. Launch a 128-bit ship (a submarine) and ask me, ~tasfyn-partyv, for one. We’ll send you one, two, or a dozen. You can be as anonymous as you want, if you’re polite. But, if the network lives, a destroyer price will develop. It will be very low at first, but not zero. Urbit is designed to be free as in speech. It’s not designed to be free as in beer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How, cryptographically, are cloud ships distributed? And how are packets routed? The answer is the same - the prefix hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Urbit’s naval terminology, ships above 64 bits are “submarines.” 64-bit ships are “yachts.” 32-bit, “destroyers.” 16-bit, “cruisers.” 8-bit, “carriers.” This also resembles a feudal hierarchy, so it comes with a feudal terminology. There are 256 imperial carriers, 65.280 royal cruisers, 4.294.901.760 rebel destroyers, uncounted scads of private yachts, and more or less infinitely many rogue submarines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every ship but a submarine has a “will,” or certificate chain - a linked list of “deeds.” The first deed in this list is signed by the ship’s hierarchical prefix, or “flagship.” Mere submarine are independent; carriers create cruisers; cruisers create destroyers; destroyers create yachts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A submarine is the fingerprint of its own public key; a carrier’s fingerprint is predefined in the kernel. Anyone can create any number of 128-bit submarines, whose free and independent society the 64-bit naval hierarchy cannot interfere with. And of course, since Urbit is (a) in the public domain and (b) not patented, anyone can fork Urbit and change the carrier fingerprints. Anyone can also create his own independent and incompatible DNS, but efforts in this direction have not been crowned with great success. In general, the easier it is technically to fork open-source code or an open standard, the less likely a fork is to actually happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An independent ship is an independent reputation. Your flagship hierarchy, though it created your ship, has no control over it - so your reputations are and should be separate. But there are not 2^64 independent reputations in Urbit, only 2^32. Cruisers have no control over the destroyers they create, but yachts have no independence from the destroyers that created them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for this is simple - a destroyer corresponds not to a person, but to any institution with its own independent reputation. Yachts are for users, bots, or other sub-identities of this institution. Each destroyer has 2^32 of them, which is, of course, a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does independence work in practice? By pinning/TOFU. For any deed number, or “life,” the first instance is accepted. Thus when changing secrets, perhaps to transfer a ship, the donor signs a new deed created by the recipient. Once any ship sees this deed, it will never accept another signed by the old owner. Thus, a cruiser cannot sell the same new destroyer twice. Similarly, deed 7 of ~tasfyn-partyv signs deed 8; but no ship which has a deed 8 for ~tasfyn-partyv will either accept deed 7, or any other purported deed 8 which deed 7 later signs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preventing a “double spend” thus depends on propagating the latest deed. For this purpose, the ocean is divided into two kinds of ships: friends and non-friends of the ship being transferred. The ship has a list of its cryptographic partners, or “neighbors,” for which it holds a symmetric key and a routing (IP) address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new owner sends the new deed to all the neighbors, thus locking the old owner out of them. Future new friends will get the new owner’s will the same way they get the new owner’s IP address - by a lookup through the flagship hierarchy. Thus if we update both neighbors and flagship, the old owner is locked out and the new owner is locked in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically, this is very much an imperfect procedure. It relies on social trust to make it effective. For example, a malicious seller could edit his neighbor list before delivering the ship. You probably don’t want to buy a used destroyer from someone you distrust. Of course, the same is true of cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And more broadly, the naval hierarchy can and should provide general administrative support. For one thing, the big ships route your packets, at least when establishing contact with your fellow destroyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So - do you want an Urbit destroyer? You know you do. Moreover, they’re free. Of course, if you are satisfied with a name that looks like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    ~machec-binnev-dordeb-sogduc--dosmul-sarrum-faplec-nidted&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you can keep swimming around Urbit in your submarine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a while, anyway. Because, besides memorability, there is another reason for short names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s neat about short names is that there’s a finite number of them. This is not a bug, but a feature. Essentially, to borrow the thinking of political scientist James Scott, a finite space is &lt;em&gt;governable&lt;/em&gt;. An infinite space is ungovernable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are an infinite number of identities, there is no way for anyone to distinguish between a new user and a banned user. A reputation can be punished by destroying it, but anyone can start again at zero. A parasite whose only reason to use the network is to abuse it can keep coming back for more. An email spammer will never run out of addresses to spam from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IPv4 is a limited space, which almost but doesn’t cure spam. The problem is that IPv4 addresses are neither personal nor property, so there is generally no easy way to punish a spammer as he deserves through IP blacklisting. He is very unlikely to be in any sense the owner of the IP address on his packets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if the email address and the IP address were the same thing, and the present fuzzy economic relationship between the user of an IP address were clear and simple, killing spam would become easy. You spam from a destroyer; you go on a list of spammers; no one will accept your unsolicited messages, ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can get around this. You can buy a new destroyer. But the thing is - it costs you &lt;em&gt;money&lt;/em&gt;. You’re not spamming for the fun of it. If a destroyer costs a mere $1, the spam you send from it needs to earn you $1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does not make it trivial for the forces of light to hunt you down and render you into processed meat clippings. But it sure as heck evens the game. Who will win? I guess we’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So do you want an Urbit destroyer? Read the &lt;a href=&quot;/2013/11/18/urbit-is-easy-ch1.html&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; for instructions. Come on, they’re free&lt;/p&gt;</content>
